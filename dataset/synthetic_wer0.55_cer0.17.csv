Ukrainian newspapers say that the threat of war has been averted, but warn that Russia may now attempt a plan of ""creeping federalisation"" to split the country.
Most of the major Russian dailies adopt a staunch pro-government stance, praising President Putin as a ""man in control"" who has clearly outlined his ""negotiating positions"" to the West and Ukraine.
Russian pundits dwell not so much on the messages relayed by Mr Putin but rather on the political and personal qualities that they feel he displayed during the news conference.
Izvestiya daily notes that the president was ""calm and confident"" and ""clearly answered all questions"" asked by journalists.
""By not going to war, Putin proved himself as a statesman, not just as a tactician,"" says an editorial in Vedomosti, adding that a crisis in relations with a neighbour ""is a maturity test for every head of state"".

The UN and rights groups have repeatedly accused Syria of targeting civilian areas.
On Friday, the Combined Joint Task Force said that the US-led coalition had carried out another 31 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.
Sixteen of Friday's strikes were in Syria, with 13 of those targeting areas around Kobane on the Turkey border.
The 15 air strikes in Iraq were in seven different areas.
Barrel bombs are large cylindrical metal containers filled with explosive and shrapnel that are typically rolled out of the door of a helicopter.
The BBC's Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale says that the bombs were initially dropped from a low altitude, which afforded a reasonable degree of accuracy.
However Syrian government helicopters have been forced to drop them from greater heights because rebel fighters have managed to acquire surface-to-air missiles.","Why i, Assad kikkingaus? Muy Grenbring vengeance rn bumt""

Vinci, the world number 43 and playing her first Grand Slam semi-final, caused a huge upset with a 2-6 6-4 6-4 win.
Williams, 33, had been two wins from completing a clean sweep of all four majors in 2015.
Vinci, 32, will play Flavia Pennetta in an all-Italian final at Flushing Meadows on Saturday.
Pennetta, the 26th seed, outplayed Romanian second seed Simona Halep in the first semi-final to win 6-1 6-3.
Saturday will see the first Grand Slam final between two Italian players since the Open era began in 1968.
Williams's hopes of winning a first calendar Slam ended just two victories short, and in the most sensational of upsets.
The American had survived 11 final sets in Grand Slam matches during 2015, but at the 12th time of asking came up against an opponent who simply grew stronger.
When Williams smashed her racquet after dropping the second set it was clear that the tension was beginning to boil over, and her cries of ""come on"" in the third set took on an increasingly desperate air.
There was still the possibility that Vinci would crumble in the decider, but she served out to love with two nerveless half-volleys for the win of her life.

Williams appeared edgy from the outset, dropping serve with her sixth error as early as game three, but when she reeled off five games to take the set it appeared the nerves had settled.
Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, had said he wanted her to ""use the stress to lift her level"" but it appeared to have the opposite effect in the second set.
Vinci's clever mix of spins and length played on the American's nerves and began to draw errors, a wayward forehand giving up the only break in game five.
Williams earned a break point at 5-4 down but Vinci fired a forehand into the corner and took the set, prompting the four-time champion to smash her racquet and receive a code violation.
By the time Vinci recovered an early break to level at 2-2 in the decider, Williams was screaming at herself just for winning points on serve.
Two double faults opened the door for Vinci to break in game seven, and when the moment came to try and close out the match, she produced the service game of her life.","This is one of the biggest npsers inatha bisroryaof te  isl because cfawhatrwas onrrhe li.e.""r

Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday.
The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97.
One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm.
Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield.
Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton).
The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea.
The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system.

It is true that in their practice many politicians repudiate Gandhi.
Yet outside politics, in the sphere of social activism for example, he remains an inspiration.
The work of [social activists like] Ela Bhatt and Sewa or of Abhay and Rani Bang, is moderately well known; there are hundreds of such individuals and groups, who work away from the public gaze, in the fields of rural health care, women's empowerment, environmental restoration, all inspired in lesser or greater degree by Gandhi.
But if Gandhi's ideas have indeed survived, are they relevant in today's age? If so, how?
In my view, four aspects of Gandhi's legacy remain relevant, not just to India, but to the world.
First, non-violent resistance to unjust laws and/or authoritarian governments.
Second, the promotion of inter-faith understanding and religious tolerance.
Third, an economic model that does not rape or pillage nature.
Fourth, courtesy in public debate and transparency in one's public dealings.
A curious testimony to Gandhi's continuing relevance is the continuing vehemence of the attacks on him by radicals of left and right.","Canayou give us some riceptaexamples?hlIn Inehu,rthe most important aee influential of Gundhi's ideas is rin we affnrm everyday without recrgnu nngnutrwoees from bima- ourrconstitutional commitment to lingui tiwapluauknsmnand diversity.
