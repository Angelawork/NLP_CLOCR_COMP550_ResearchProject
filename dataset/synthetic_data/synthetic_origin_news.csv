1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,(CNN) -- Italy has moved to defuse a diplomatic dispute with India by agreeing to send back two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen last year.
1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,"The two Italian marines are due to face trial in India over the allegations, but after the Indian Supreme Court allowed them to return to Italy last month to vote in national elections, Rome refused to send them back."
1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,"That decision angered Indian government officials and Supreme Court justices, who noted that the Italian ambassador had given assurances to the court that the marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, would come back to India after the elections."
1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,"The court responded last week by temporarily banning the ambassador, Daniele Mancini, from leaving India, a move that Italy said violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."
1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,"The two sides appeared locked in an impasse, with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saying Italy's actions were ""not acceptable"" and warning of ""consequences"" for the two countries' relations."
1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,"On Thursday, the Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's office said it would make good on the commitment to send the sailors back after receiving written assurances from the Indian government that the two men's ""fundamental rights"" would be protected."
1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,"The two sailors have agreed to the decision, it said."
1d15619b6441fd0149b2e45b8e82d06a643cb178,CNN/Daily Mail,"The Indian government appeared to welcome the move, with Home Affairs Minister R.P.N."

26449536,XSum,"In his first public comments on the Ukrainian crisis, Mr Putin said on Tuesday that Moscow reserved the right to act to protect Russian citizens and speakers anywhere in Ukraine, but added that military action was ""a last resort"".
Ukrainian newspapers say that the threat of war has been averted, but warn that Russia may now attempt a plan of ""creeping federalisation"" to split the country.
Most of the major Russian dailies adopt a staunch pro-government stance, praising President Putin as a ""man in control"" who has clearly outlined his ""negotiating positions"" to the West and Ukraine.
Russian pundits dwell not so much on the messages relayed by Mr Putin but rather on the political and personal qualities that they feel he displayed during the news conference.
Izvestiya daily notes that the president was ""calm and confident"" and ""clearly answered all questions"" asked by journalists.
""By not going to war, Putin proved himself as a statesman, not just as a tactician,"" says an editorial in Vedomosti, adding that a crisis in relations with a neighbour ""is a maturity test for every head of state"".
Writing in Moskovskiy Komsomolets, Mikhail Rostovsky says that ""having faced such a heavy flow of threats from almost all Western leaders"" Mr Putin did not look like a ""frightened politician"" but behaved like it was ""water off a duck's back"".
""Vladimir Putin communicated indirectly with his G8 colleaguesâ€¦ and defined his negotiating positions,"" says the article.
""The president feels the master of the situation,"" exclaims Nikolai Petrov in Nezavisimaya Gazeta."
26449536,XSum,"He argues that Mr Putin's position is ""strengthened by the fact that the new Ukrainian authorities are not in control of Eastern Ukraineâ€¦ and also by the fact that the West cannot quickly provide the money that Kiev desperately needs""."
26449536,XSum,"That is why ""with each passing day Kiev is pushed towards making concessions to Putin,"" concludes the pundit.
""Putin made his move."
26449536,XSum,"It's the turn of Ukraine and the West to respond,"" another political analyst, Igor Bunin, tells Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
""Confessions of a mad aggressor"" is how the main headline in Ukrainian daily Ukrayina Moloda describes the news conference by President Putin.
A cartoon on its front page shows the Russian president sporting an ""I love Ukraine"" badge."
26449536,XSum,"He is wearing a nappy, with an olive branch in one hand and a toy tank in the other."
26449536,XSum,"""While listening to the leader of one of the biggest and most powerful countries of the world, one starts worrying not only about Ukraine, but also about the entire world,"" the paper comments.
Ukrainian commentators are sceptical about Mr Putin's claims that he will not yet resort to the use of force.
""There will be no military aggression, but he will not give up on Crimea,"" Vadym Karasyov tells Kommersant Ukraina."
26449536,XSum,"He predicts that Crimea ""will remain part of Ukraine but will be turned into Ukraine's Dniester region""."
26449536,XSum,"The mainly Russian-speaking Trans-Dniester region proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 and Russian troops now have a heavy presence there.
The front page of the daily Den carries a picture of soldiers putting up a Ukrainian flag in defiance at Belbek airport in Crimea, apparently surrounded by Russian troops with machine guns."
26449536,XSum,"""We are proud of you"" is the main headline."
26449536,XSum,"""Restraint and patriotism displayed by the Ukrainian military marked a turning point in the Crimean situation,"" says the paper, while warning that ""it is too early to relax"".
Den also quotes pundit Olena Hetmanchuk as saying that Vladimir Putin's seemingly peaceful tone ""is a tactical defeat"".
""We should brace ourselves for a long exhausting war which will not be waged with the help of tanks."
26449536,XSum,"This news conference marked the start of a new phase of Putin's diplomatic and PR war,"" she argues.

8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"(CNN) -- Back in 1971, I was present as top leaders of two political organizations met to negotiate common actions they could take despite their differences."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,One of those leaders was a woman.
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Over and over, she raised points for consideration, only to be ignored by both sides."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"When someone of the other team did agree with a proposal she made, he would wait a few minutes and then say so to one of her male colleagues, as though the suggestion had been his."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"""As you said, Jerry,"" or ""That's probably the way to go, Sam."" No one on her team corrected the misattribution, though they laughed about it afterward."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"As the woman matter-of-factly explained to me, ""He couldn't admit anything we said was right if he also had to admit that it had come from a woman."" How far have we come in 40 years? According to a new book on the the Obama administration, many of the president's advisers initially showed similar disregard for women."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"For the first two years, senior female aides complained that male colleagues ignored them, excluded them from key policy meetings, dismissed their opinions and limited their access to the president."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"It is clear, however, that we have come a long way."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"When told of the women's concerns, President Barack Obama convened a dinner with the female staff and took steps to make the atmosphere more inclusive and empowering."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Our nation now has three women on the Supreme Court, all of whom out-talk at least one of their male colleagues."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"And we have a female secretary of state who by all accounts does not get muscled aside by anyone, male or female."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,Assessing the extent and impact of gender stereotypes is more complex today than it was in the early 1960s.
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Back then, ""head and master"" laws gave husbands the final say in most family decisions."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,Quotas limited the number of women who could be admitted to law or dental school.
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"""Help wanted"" ads for men only excluded women from even applying for most highly paid and challenging jobs."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"And of course, men and women in the same jobs were treated differently in salary and promotions."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Women now earn more B.A.'s and M.A.'s than men do, and they have pulled even in Ph.D's."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Today, education trumps gender in determining pay, with the result that in most metropolitan regions women in their 20s tend to out-earn men in the same age group because of their greater educational achievement."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"By contrast, in 1970, a female college graduate who worked full-time year-round earned less than a white male high school graduate."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"As President Obama's senior staff discovered, gender stereotypes still encourage men to dominate and females to defer, perpetuating women's second-class status in the workforce."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Yet these same stereotypes can also penalize males in ways that were not obvious in the past, when male privilege had so many more legal and administrative supports."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"The mystique of masculinity, for example, encourages many men to view studying hard as ""a girl thing."" It also leads many to seek work in the unstable, seasonal construction sector or in other ""manly"" jobs, many of which are concentrated in declining industries, rather than preparing themselves for ""traditionally female"" jobs in health care, child care, teaching, and social work.""Manly"" males bully other males who show interest in such work, accusing them of acting ""gay"" or being ""girlie-men."" And when men defy these stereotypes to seek such work, they often encounter gender discrimination from employers who believe that a man cannot be as good a nurturer or helper as a woman."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"But at the top of the educational, economic, and political pyramid -- in what were traditionally ""male"" kinds of work -- gender stereotypes continue to penalize women."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Catalyst, an organization formed in 1962 to help women enter the workplace, titled its 2007 report on the attitudes of more than 1,200 senior executives in the United States and Europe toward female employees: ""Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don't."" According to their report, when women ""act assertively, focus on work tasks, display ambition,"" or engage in other behaviors that receive high praise when done by men, they are perceived as ""too tough"" and ""unfeminine."" But when women pay attention to work relationships and express ""concern for other people's perspective,"" they are considered less competent than men."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"In the television news industry, two-thirds of the news producers, but only 20 percent of the news directors, are female."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Men make up more than three-quarters of all workers earning more than $100,000 a year, and only 2 percent of Fortune 500 companies are run by women."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,Part of this pattern may stem from women's socialization not to put themselves forward too much.
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"Young women are four times less likely than young men to negotiate their first salary, and economists estimate that this unwillingness to assert their own worth as workers ends up costing women $500,000 in earnings by the time they reach 60."
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,But part of the problem is that women's worth is consistently undervalued by others.
8c76a9cc6d489f88429feb2c5b58248cce3ec666,CNN/Daily Mail,"A March 2010 study by the American Association of University Women found that among postdoctoral applicants, women had to publish three more papers in the most prestigious journals, or 20 more in the less-prestigious ones, to be considered as productive as male applicants."

fd89fe1d38246436f1e7ff97ddb24489bb292495,CNN/Daily Mail,There were setbacks along the way -- a back injury in 2000 almost finished her career and the birth of a son the following year meant she had to juggle parental responsibilities alongside training - but her commitment paid off in the long run.
fd89fe1d38246436f1e7ff97ddb24489bb292495,CNN/Daily Mail,Bronze medals at the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games preceded her historic gold medal performance at the Commonwealth Games.

fd89fe1d38246436f1e7ff97ddb24489bb292495,CNN/Daily Mail,But the narrative that seeks to re-write traditional attitudes towards women in wider Indian society is only just beginning.

fd89fe1d38246436f1e7ff97ddb24489bb292495,CNN/Daily Mail,If she is educated she will give good virtues to her children she can change the atmosphere of her house.

d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,9 online edition of the journal Nature.
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,"Launched in 2002, two GRACE satellites whip around Earth in tandem 16 times a day at an altitude of about 300 miles, sensing subtle variations in Earth's mass and gravitational pull."
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,"Separated by roughly 135 miles, the satellites measure changes in Earth's gravity field caused by regional changes in the planet's mass, including ice sheets, oceans and water stored in the soil and in underground aquifers."
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,"A positive change in gravity during a satellite approach over Greenland, for example, tugs the lead GRACE satellite away from the trailing satellite, speeding it up and increasing the distance between the two."
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,A sensitive ranging system allows researchers to measure the distance of the two satellites down to as small as 1 micron- about 1/100 the width of a human hair - and to calculate ice and water amounts from particular regions of interest around the globe using their gravity fields.
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,"‘The total amount of ice lost to Earth's oceans from 2003 to 2010 would cover the entire United States in about 1 and one-half feet of water,’ said Wahr, also a fellow at the CU-headquartered Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences."
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,"According to the GRACE data, total sea level rise from all land-based ice on Earth including Greenland and Antarctica was roughly 1.5 millimeters per year annually or about 12 millimeters, or one-half inch, from 2003 to 2010, said Wahr."
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,"The sea rise amount does include the expansion of water due to warming, which is the second key sea-rise component and is roughly equal to melt totals, he said."
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,"‘One big question is how sea level rise is going to change in this century,’ said Pfeffer."
d5cb257fb71ea81412f72c99a2598e920d37ac7e,CNN/Daily Mail,‘If we could understand the physics more completely and perfect numerical models to simulate all of the processes controlling sea level -- especially glacier and ice sheet changes -- we would have a much better means to make predictions.

8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,We talked to two 14-year-olds who don't want to go on camera.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"They had arrived that day from Italy, after traveling through Iran, Turkey and Greece."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,The story they told us is typical: Their families paid thousands of dollars to send them to the west in the hands of smugglers.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,The journey was extremely perilous.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"They traveled in the backs of trucks, cars and at times walking across mountain ranges; it took them nine months to get to Paris."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"Like many of the children we spoke to, they risked frostbite during their dangerous traversing of mountains in Iran and Turkey."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,They claimed Iranian border guards shot at them as they crossed the frontier.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,But despite of the risks they kept going -- lured by the promises of lucrative jobs in France.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,The reality when they arrive is very different. Most of them are aged between 14 and 18 years old.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"Theoretically the French state has a duty of care for unaccompanied minors, but these teenagers must prove their age."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"Often they don't have the documents necessary to show their age, and so they are left to sleep on the streets."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"One charity, France Terre d'Asile (France: Haven) is trying to help, but it is hopelessly overwhelmed."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"The group estimates that some 6,000 foreign children arrive illegally in France each year -- most turn up in Paris expecting to be able to work to send money home to their families."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"That is, of course, illegal, so there are faced with entering the black market or surviving on handouts."

8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"When we were there, 45 children turned up needing somewhere to sleep."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,It was cold and raining and only the youngest were admitted.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,The rest were forced to once again sleep on the streets.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"Mohammed is typical: He spent three months sleeping in a park before finally getting a hotel room provided by the French state, once he was able to prove he was 16 years old."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,He was lucky: his sister was able to fax a copy of his birth certificate.
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"But many of his friends are still sleeping outside, because they can't prove their age."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"He tells me about the frequent fights between different ethnics groups -- Tajiks beaten by Hazaras, Pashtuns clashing with Bangladeshis."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"Muggings, drug abuse and the ever present sex-trade were all daily risks for him."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"His story is a microcosm of the problems that have consumed Afghanistan for three decades: He was orphaned by war and disease -- his father was killed by the Taliban, his mother died of tuberculosis."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"His uncle physically abused him for years until finally his brother-in-law agreed to lend him $6,000 so he could buy his passage to the west, but on arriving in Paris, his dreams of a job and a new life were quickly shattered."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"Now he has begun to make a start on improving his life, learning French, and getting his first taste of the internet."
8dca7070472c35088a2dd003a0250dbdf189da06,CNN/Daily Mail,"His prospects remain bleak, but at least he has a bed to sleep in each night -- unlike so many of the other Afghan children who are surviving on the streets of Paris."

98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"Many in the party wanted Gordon Brown to take control of Scottish Labour, but he declined to return to frontline politics."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"However, Mr Murphy said: 'I envision Gordon Brown having a big part to play."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,I spoke to him at length and I would like Gordon to have a big part in our election campaign.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,'He was so formidable during the referendum campaign and I want him to use his energy and passion again for Scottish Labour.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,'It will be for geeing up the troops but also for convincing voters.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,Labour has got to come together as a team because teams win whereas divided groups lose.' Mr Alexander would be an easy target as Mr Salmond could blame him for the Tory-LibDem austerity programme.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"Latest polls suggest the LibDems could be wiped out in nearly all their seats north of the Border, except Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael's Orkney and Shetland stronghold."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"However, a Scottish Liberal Democrat spokeswoman said: 'If the man who installed the hated average speed cameras on the A9, abolished Northern Constabulary and stood by the routine arming of police wants to run for a seat nearly 100 miles from his home, we think he should bring it on."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"People in Inverness deserve better than being someone's second best.' Mr Salmond is known to be fond of working in Westminster, and was an MP for Banff and Buchan for 23 years until 2010."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"He could return as the party's Westminster leader, replacing Angus Robertson who observers believe has already been sidelined."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,The SNP has not yet chosen its candidates for May's General Election.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,Mr Salmond will almost certainly not contest his old Banff and Buchan seat as it already represented by the party's Eilidh Whiteford.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"In Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, Mr Alexander's main challenge came from Labour in the 2010 General Election."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"But the Holyrood seat of Inverness and Nairn is represented by the SNP's Fergus Ewing, who won in 2011 with a massive majority of nearly 10,000, and Nationalist strategists believe they can therefore challenge Mr Alexander next May."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"The easier option for Mr Salmond would be Gordon, where the LibDems currently have a majority of 6,748 on a 36 per cent share of the vote."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"The SNP moved ahead of Labour and the Tories into second place in 2010, and in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Mr Salmond was returned in Aberdeenshire East with a massive majority of 15,295."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"One LibDem source in the area said: 'We haven't heard anything officially, but we're expecting Salmond to make an announcement any day."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,'But we're confident we can beat him – he's not as popular as he was in 2011 and the referendum saw a 60 per cent No vote in this area.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"People used to see him as invincible, but that's not the case now."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"'He's something of a spent force.' During an episode of the BBC show Question Time last month, filmed in Liverpool, Mr Salmond was asked by presenter David Dimbleby whether he would consider a return to Westminster."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"The First Minister replied: 'The answer to your question David, absolutely decisively I can tell you I haven't made up my mind."
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,So you'll have to wait and see.
98d93985572f8d2b715ec3d2d450baaa8f5fd5df,CNN/Daily Mail,"'But I tell you what, when I do make up my mind, invite me back on to Question Time and I'll tell you why I did it.' Mr Dimbleby asked Mr Salmond: 'So it is not a closed door?' Mr Salmond replied: 'You can take that from what I have just told you David, that's right'."

53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,The Acropolis Museum – the showpiece institution which displays many of the artefacts from the famous hill that has long been the heart of the Greek capital – has announced an ambitious idea that sees it ‘colour in’ some of its key exhibits through digital technology.

53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"Stones from the celebrated structure’s west frieze – which show a procession of pilgrims paying tribute to Athena, the Greek goddess who gave her name to the city – have been ‘resurrected’ in this manner, with flowing capes and brandished weapons."
53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,The images have been 'scanned' onto the ancient stones to show them as they would have appeared some two-and-a-half millennia ago.

53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"A striking structure of glass and concrete, the museum opened in June 2009 as a modern showcase for the treasures of the Acropolis – on whose southern slope it sits."
53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"‘In the first five years of life, the Acropolis Museum has fulfilled our country’s high expectations,’ says Dimitros Pandermalis, the museum’s president."

53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"Its arrival has rekindled the debate about the fate of the Elgin Marbles – panels from the Parthenon which, notoriously, are currently on show at the British Museum in London."
53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"While the Acropolis Museum holds around half of the Great Panathenaia – the main frieze which circled the Parthenon, telling a single story about worship in the ancient city – the other half has been kept in London for over two centuries."

53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"However, the advent of the Acropolis Museum as a world-class facility on the doorsteps of the temple has amplified the calls for the Marbles to return home."
53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"‘We comfortably welcome 3,000 visitors a day, and we are proud to have been recognised as being amongst the three best museums in the world,’ Mr Pandermalis adds."

53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"Long viewed as one of the finest remnants of the ancient era (although it was not considered one of the original ‘Seven Wonders of the World’), the Parthenon was constructed in the fifth century BC."
53a3f4dc1010cd2d1e87f3298857a131825a828a,CNN/Daily Mail,"It remains an Athenian landmark, visible from most corners of the city."

30603679,XSum,"The barrel-bombs, crudely made drums of explosives, were dropped during Thursday and overnight, targeting al-Bab and Qabaseen near Aleppo.
Activists say the government has stepped up air raids in recent days.
Some 200,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad erupted in 2011.
Another 3.2 million people have fled Syria and 7.6 million have been displaced inside the country.
Al-Bab, a city of about 100,000 people, has witnessed heavy government air strikes since September, when a US-led coalition started targeting IS in Iraq and Syria.
One Qabaseen resident, Yousef al-Saadi, told Reuters via Skype: ""People were going about scraping a living and there were no armed groups in the market, only poor people."
30603679,XSum,"Why is Assad killing us? May God bring vengeance on him.""
The UN and rights groups have repeatedly accused Syria of targeting civilian areas.
On Friday, the Combined Joint Task Force said that the US-led coalition had carried out another 31 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.
Sixteen of Friday's strikes were in Syria, with 13 of those targeting areas around Kobane on the Turkey border.
The 15 air strikes in Iraq were in seven different areas.
Barrel bombs are large cylindrical metal containers filled with explosive and shrapnel that are typically rolled out of the door of a helicopter.
The BBC's Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale says that the bombs were initially dropped from a low altitude, which afforded a reasonable degree of accuracy.
However Syrian government helicopters have been forced to drop them from greater heights because rebel fighters have managed to acquire surface-to-air missiles."
30603679,XSum,"This makes the air raids less accurate.
Despite being rudimentary weapons, their destructive power is considerable.
They are only one part of the arsenal that Syria has employed against civilian areas and their use could well constitute a war crime, our correspondent adds."

42902a3116626906f3aa1558e9cce108811d88a9,CNN/Daily Mail,"That means more time for students, educators and guidance and admissions counselors to understand the changes -- and more time for the College Board's Khan Academy test prep program to gear up."
42902a3116626906f3aa1558e9cce108811d88a9,CNN/Daily Mail,"Partnering with the free, online resource is intended to make the SAT more transparent, and cut back on perceptions of inequality around expensive test preparation services, Coleman explained Wednesday."

42902a3116626906f3aa1558e9cce108811d88a9,CNN/Daily Mail,"""Our intention in this partnership is this will be the best thing out there, and it happens to be free."" On April 16, the College Board will release more detailed specifications about the test and sample test questions."

42902a3116626906f3aa1558e9cce108811d88a9,CNN/Daily Mail,"For students, Coleman said, ""we hope you breathe a sigh of relief that this exam will be focused, useful, open, clear, and aligned with the work you will do throughout high school.""

29704020,XSum,"The number of inquiries questioning GCSE and A-level grades rose even more sharply, up by 48% to 450,500, according to exam watchdog Ofqual.
""Every such change has a big impact on the individuals affected,"" said education minister Nick Gibb.
""There is a growing lack of confidence in the exam system,"" said head teachers' leader Brian Lightman.
School leaders have voiced concerns about the quality of marking this summer - and the figures from Ofqual, for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, show a big increase in inquiries to the ""review of marking service"", up by 56% to almost 444,000.
There were warnings that mistakes in marking could mean that young people missed out on university places or being able to stay on to take A-levels.
Overall, about one in every 33 scripts marked this year resulted in an inquiry about marking or grades.
If schools and parents are not satisfied by the response to this inquiry, they can make a further appeal, and about one in five of these challenges resulted in a grade being changed.
This meant 45,500 grades have been corrected - up by 15% compared with the results of summer 2013."
29704020,XSum,"It represents a much bigger increase over the last few years - about 50% more grade changes than 2011.
""We're not surprised to hear that there has been a significant increase in requests for re-marks."
29704020,XSum,"Many schools have told us of a worrying number of results which simply did not reflect how well students should have done,"" said Mr Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.
""Schools need to be able to trust the marks given to students."
29704020,XSum,"They need to know that examinations will be marked accurately, fairly and in a timely manner.""
Mr Lightman said it remained unclear whether the increase in appeals is due to a ""fundamental weaknesses in marking"".
But he warned that the ""lack of confidence in the exam system which has been exacerbated by frequent and ad hoc changes to qualifications"".
The overall proportion of exam grades being changed remains low, but has increased for both A-levels and GCSEs."
29704020,XSum,"This year, 0.52% of GCSE grades and 0.65% of A-level grades have been changed.
Richard Harman, chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of independent schools, said: ""We have been concerned about the accuracy of exam marking for many years, and so it is extremely worrying to see a new leap in the figures for re-grades this year.""
""The college or university places of tens of thousands of students have been needlessly jeopardised this autumn and the exam boards must be made to do much better.""
Education Minister Nick Gibb said: ""It is essential that students can be confident that their hard work will be accurately assessed and the exams they sit properly marked.
""Parents, pupils and schools must have faith in exam marking and we are working closely with Ofqual and the exam boards to ensure this is the case."""

 One of the firefighting teams trying to contain the Rim Fire in and around Yosemite National Park is the Geronimo Hotshots team from San Carlos, Ariz., one of seven elite Native American firefighting crews in the U.S."
,Multi-News,"On the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, firefighting jobs are one of only a few ways for many young men to earn a living."
,Multi-News,"For team member Jose Alvarez Santi Jr., 25, the work is rewarding — but being away from home fighting fires can be tough."
,Multi-News,"""I don't really see it as a job."
,Multi-News,"Being out away from my family — that's the part that I'm down about, is just being away,"" Santi said not long before the team got the call to fight the Rim Fire."
,Multi-News,Santi has a 3-year-old son.
,Multi-News,He's only seen him for a dozen or so days this entire spring and summer.
,Multi-News,"The 20-member crew works a fire for 14 days, then it's a long trip home for maybe one or two days of rest, then back out again."
,Multi-News,This late in the season you can see this is starting to take its toll on a lot of the guys.
,Multi-News,"But they know it's also good money. In a good year, you could make $40,000. That goes far here."
,Multi-News,"Enlarge this image toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR 
  
 ""Of course the wife's lovin' it,"" said senior firefighter Tom Patton."
,Multi-News,"""Right now, just can't wait to get out of here. I wanna go on another fire."
,Multi-News,"It's our only means of supporting our family."" 
  
 As on most reservations, jobs are hard to come by, and most families live well below the poverty line."
,Multi-News,There are a few jobs with the tribal government or at the small casino on the outskirts of the reservation.
,Multi-News,But much of the community is dependent on the fire season.
,Multi-News,"""It's Essential"" 
  
 The only restaurant in town is the San Carlos Cafe."
,Multi-News,It's in a worn stone building built by the U.S. government at the turn of the 20th century.
,Multi-News,The menu on the wall features the hot shot breakfast burrito.
,Multi-News,"The owner, Jo Lazo, says the firefighters are looked up to here."
,Multi-News,"""I like to say our Apache men are the strongest of all firefighters."
,Multi-News,"I think it just goes down through genealogy and the struggle that we had many, many years ago."
,Multi-News,"We never go down without a fight,"" she says. 
  
 Lazo is proud and pragmatic."
,Multi-News,"The Hotshot crew members are regulars here, and that's good for business."
,Multi-News,But the tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs also employ hundreds more seasonal firefighters.
,Multi-News,"During a big fire year, everyone has more money in his or her pocket, including Lazo."
,Multi-News,Her cafe caters all the meals for the crews if there's a wildfire near here.
,Multi-News,"""And it's sad when there is a fire because we do lose a lot of vegetation, but it's essential and it's been essential for years,"" Lazo says."
,Multi-News,It's hard to find someone around San Carlos who doesn't have a father or brother or sister who's a wildland firefighter.
,Multi-News,"In fact, by late last week, the town seemed almost empty of anyone between 18 and 35."
,Multi-News,"""Yeah, right now everybody's out on the fire."
,Multi-News,"They're up in Idaho, up in Oregon, up in Washington,"" says Frank Rolling Thunder."
,Multi-News,He has fought fires since the '70s.
,Multi-News,"He says for a lot of people here, firefighting isn't just good money — it's a ticket off this isolated reservation."
,Multi-News,And opportunities like those don't come along that often.
,Multi-News,"""First time we went out to Yosemite National Park ..."
,Multi-News,"there were sequoias and I'd never seen them,"" Rolling Thunder says."
,Multi-News,"""It gives me the opportunity to go see all kinds of different places — the Cascades, Mount Shasta, Mount Hood."" 
  
 Representing The San Carlos Apaches 
  
 The team had only a short two days of R&R; before getting the call to go to Yosemite."
,Multi-News,"As word spread from man to man at the tribal forestry office, the buzz in the room changed."
,Multi-News,A little anxiety was added to the anticipation.
,Multi-News,A few guys drifted away to make last minute phone calls.
,Multi-News,A couple more moved their motorcycles into the garage. They'll be gone for a while.
,Multi-News,"""Right now's the time where everybody kinda double checks, makes sure they got everything they need, make their last calls to their family,"" Santi says."
,Multi-News,"For Santi, this is the moment when it becomes clear what it means to be a Geronimo Hotshot."
,Multi-News,"""I hold the name up high. Wherever I go, my family, they're proud of what I do,"" he says."
,Multi-News,Santi says it's not just about fighting fire or saving people's homes.

,Multi-News,"||||| YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK -- Even as more than 4,000 firefighters battle the ferocious Rim fire -- the nation’s top wildland fire priority -- they have to tread carefully in Yosemite National Park."
,Multi-News,"Much of the park is designated as wilderness, where vehicles and roads are prohibited by federal law."
,Multi-News,"For fire commanders, that means that they can’t deploy bulldozers to plow fire lines, nor can they send crews in with fire trucks."
,Multi-News,"In extreme cases, officials order smoke jumping crews to parachute into backcountry and drop supplies and tools."
,Multi-News,"It is possible to obtain an exemption from the law’s provisions, but incident commanders must get written permission to do so."
,Multi-News,"Another consideration in the park are the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers, which have federal protections as Wild and Scenic Rivers."
,Multi-News,Hand crews would try to avoid clearing around the rivers and fire aviation managers are mindful to give the rivers wide berth when dropping retardant.
,Multi-News,"“Everyone is very careful about that and they have experience with it,” said Tom Medema, Yosemite’s chief of interpretation."
,Multi-News,"“So far, we haven’t cut lines into wilderness areas.” 
  
 The blaze – now entering its 12th day – has burned 187,466 acres and is on pace to soon become the sixth-largest fire in state history."
,Multi-News,The fire is 23% contained.
,Multi-News,"While firefighters have used the Tuolumne River and granite formations on the fire’s northern edges to set up defenses, crews have found little to work with on the blaze’s eastern front south of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir."
,Multi-News,"""They're in scouting mode,"" Dick Fleishman of the U.S. Forest Service said of fire crews."
,Multi-News,"""There's not a lot of real good areas to get out in there and do a lot of work."" 
  
 The Stanislaus National Forest is taking the brunt of the blaze, with the Groveland Ranger District making up most of the southern flank."

,Multi-News,"""It's looking better every day,"" said incident spokesman Glen Stratton."
,Multi-News,"While unmanned aircraft have mapped past fires, use of the Predator will be the longest sustained mission by a drone in California to broadcast information to firefighters in real time."
,Multi-News,"The plane, the size of a small Cessna, will remain over the burn zone for up to 22 hours at a time, allowing fire commanders to monitor fire activity, determine the fire's direction of movement, the extent of containment and confirm new fires ignited by lightning or flying embers."

c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"In truth, his contributions were limited in both positions but the tactical switch brought the consolation of a quick exit."
c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"Di Maria was well placed to dart straight down the tunnel, with a dark look on his face which failed to reflect the relief that Manchester United had rescued a late point from a game they seemed set to lose."
c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"He was almost off the pitch when he twisted his upper body towards the United fans in a distant corner of the ground and offered them some over-the-shoulder applause, but he did not allow the after-thought to interrupt his stride."

c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"Only Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Daley Blind and Phil Jones took the trouble to trudge over to the supporters."
c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"Again, not a lot had gone right for Di Maria during 90 minutes best summed up by one moment, 13 minutes into the second half when Blind, searching for a long pass to the United right, crashed the ball into the £60million Argentine, who was just a yard or two away."
c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"It was not Blind’s most stylish offering and he shrugged an apology as he digested the contents of a filthy glare from Di Maria, who could have done without another pain in the backside."

c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"At West Ham, flashes of promise were swallowed up by the peculiarities of Louis van Gaal’s system, seemingly designed to cram as many creative players as possible into the team, but rarely in their preferred positions."
c652272cc2d83c83ac95a08ac94ee8db6e51da98,CNN/Daily Mail,"They lacked pace, width and aggression and were easily neutralised by the midfield endeavour of Mark Noble and the defensive strength of James Tomkins and Cheikhou Kouyate."

Stewards banned Godolphin jockey Buick for the automatic 15 days for causing the fall and an extra 15 days for being offensive to the officials.
Boudet and Armande were not thought to be seriously injured.
Buick, 27, has said he will appeal against the original 15-day suspension, which is due to begin on 3 July.

,Multi-News,"""You can choose who your partner is."
,Multi-News,"I think birth has an influence over it, like alcoholism and some other things, but I think that basically you have a choice,"" Buck said."
,Multi-News,He also defended his handling of an alleged rape in 2005 that he declined to prosecute because he believed some of the details appeared to show the woman in question consented to the sexual encounter.
,Multi-News,"Months later, he told the Greeley Tribune that ""a jury could very well conclude that this is a case of buyer's remorse."" 
  
 ""I don't regret the way I talked to her."
,Multi-News,"I think it is important that a prosecutor approach a victim with a certain amount of reality, and that's what I've tried to do with this victim."
,Multi-News,"I didn't blame her at all,"" Buck said."

,Multi-News,"Bennet seized on Buck's defense, arguing his opponent's handling of the victim was an issue in their closely contested race."
,Multi-News,"""He just used the language again, buyer's remorse, and as the father of three little girls, I just think that's the wrong way to talk about it.""

a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,Mr Britton added that having a large cull of crocodiles in the state would be 'folly'.
a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,"'If the NT government said: ""It's open season on crocodiles and we're going to remove 50,000 crocs from the wild"", there would be some fairly serious repercussions of the way people see Australia.' Mr Britton said that according to statistics one person is killed by crocodiles in the country every two years, but there has been a 'cluster' of deaths in recent months."
a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,"As well as the crocodile attack that claimed Mr Lanh, there have been three other deaths in the Northern Territory from crocodile attacks so far this year."

a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,"Mr Britton said it was too early to tell if the deaths were a trend or a statistical 'blip' and said it was more helpful to compare the number of crocodile fatalities in Australia with those in surrounding countries, where fatalities from crocodile attacks were much more common, despite smaller populations of the animals."
a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,"Mr Britton added that while he is not in favour of a large-scale cull of the animals, he does think it is necessary to kills crocodiles who attack humans."
a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,"'I think it's an unfortunate necessity in most situations if a crocodile has killed someone, that crocodile has learned that it can successfully attack and kill someone at that location, that makes it incredibly dangerous."
a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,"I would rather see that crocodile killed and removed from the system,' he said."
a019e5ff982bcf1dff751f8df897daa13e944c11,CNN/Daily Mail,"He added that in the case of Michael Jackson it was 'unfortunate' because he was a very popular animal, but that considering he lived right next to a busy boat ramp 'it would have been madness' to let him live after he had successfully killed a human."

Her body was dumped in a brook in nearby woodland and her killer has never been found.
Her son, Daniel, 23, said South Yorkshire Police is not doing enough to find his mother's attacker.
Mr Grainger told BBC Radio Sheffield: ""I want the police to do more."

Vinci, the world number 43 and playing her first Grand Slam semi-final, caused a huge upset with a 2-6 6-4 6-4 win.
Williams, 33, had been two wins from completing a clean sweep of all four majors in 2015.
Vinci, 32, will play Flavia Pennetta in an all-Italian final at Flushing Meadows on Saturday.
Pennetta, the 26th seed, outplayed Romanian second seed Simona Halep in the first semi-final to win 6-1 6-3.
Saturday will see the first Grand Slam final between two Italian players since the Open era began in 1968.
Williams's hopes of winning a first calendar Slam ended just two victories short, and in the most sensational of upsets.
The American had survived 11 final sets in Grand Slam matches during 2015, but at the 12th time of asking came up against an opponent who simply grew stronger.
When Williams smashed her racquet after dropping the second set it was clear that the tension was beginning to boil over, and her cries of ""come on"" in the third set took on an increasingly desperate air.
There was still the possibility that Vinci would crumble in the decider, but she served out to love with two nerveless half-volleys for the win of her life.
""It was an incredible match,' said the Italian."
34227164,XSum,"""I lost the first set, and tried to stay in every point."
34227164,XSum,I tried to stay focused and not think about Serena.
34227164,XSum,"It is the best moment of my life.""
Williams remains the holder of all four major titles for another 24 hours, having completed the ""Serena Slam"" at Wimbledon - she won the Australian Open in January, before taking the French Open title in June and Wimbledon a month later.
""I don't want to talk about how disappointing this is for me,"" said Williams in her post-match news conference, which lasted just four minutes.
""If you have any other questions I'm open to that.""

On whether she felt the strain of winning the calendar Grand Slam, she added:  ""I never feel pressure and never felt that pressure to win here."
34227164,XSum,"I said that from the beginning.""
Vinci, on the other hand, delighted the crowd with a charming on-court interview.
""I am sorry for the American people, for Serena, for the Grand Slam, but today is my day, sorry guys.
""When I wake up today I say, 'OK, I have a semi-final, try to enjoy."
34227164,XSum,"Don't think about Serena.' I did not expect that I win.
""In my mind I say, 'Try to put all the balls in play."
34227164,XSum,Don't think about Serena in the other court.
34227164,XSum,"And run.' And then I won.""
Six-time US Open champion Chris Evert: ""I saw a frozen Serena Williams."
34227164,XSum,I saw a paralysed Serena Williams. She succumbed to the nerves.
34227164,XSum,"She is human.""
Two-time US Open champion Tracy Austin: ""This is monumental. It's a shocker."
34227164,XSum,"This is one of the biggest upsets in the history of tennis, because of what was on the line.""
Kristina Mladenovic, who lost to Vinci in the quarter-finals, tweeted: ""Whatever happens now I kind of feel a bit better about my loss.""
Laura Robson, the former British number one, on Twitter: ""So that was totally the result we all predicted right?""
BBC Radio 5 live sports extra's Jeff Tarango: ""I can't recall seeing in the history of women's tennis, the first and second seeds losing in the semi-finals of a Grand Slam.""
Williams appeared edgy from the outset, dropping serve with her sixth error as early as game three, but when she reeled off five games to take the set it appeared the nerves had settled.
Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, had said he wanted her to ""use the stress to lift her level"" but it appeared to have the opposite effect in the second set.
Vinci's clever mix of spins and length played on the American's nerves and began to draw errors, a wayward forehand giving up the only break in game five.
Williams earned a break point at 5-4 down but Vinci fired a forehand into the corner and took the set, prompting the four-time champion to smash her racquet and receive a code violation.
By the time Vinci recovered an early break to level at 2-2 in the decider, Williams was screaming at herself just for winning points on serve.

24467337,XSum,"The black and white story sees Patrick Troughton's second Doctor battle robot yeti in the London Underground.
Also recovered is a complete version of Troughton's six-part story The Enemy of the World.
It is thought to be the largest haul of missing episodes recovered in the last three decades.
""It's thrilling,"" said Mark Gatiss, an actor and writer for the 21st Century incarnation of Doctor Who.
""Every single avenue seemed to have been exhausted, every now and then something turns up - but to have two virtually complete stories out of the blue is absolutely incredible.""
The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s.
However, many episodes were transferred on to film for sale to foreign broadcasters."
24467337,XSum,"It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes.
In this case, 11 Doctor Who episodes were discovered, nine of which were missing, in the Nigerian city of Jos.
The find was made by Philip Morris, director of a company called Television International Enterprises Archive.
Mr Morris said: ""The tapes had been left gathering dust in a storeroom at a television relay station in Nigeria."
24467337,XSum,"I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words, Doctor Who."
24467337,XSum,"When I read the story code I realised I'd found something pretty special.""
He said it had been a ""lucky"" find given the high temperatures in the African country."
24467337,XSum,"""Fortunately they had been kept in the optimum condition.""
Only episode three of The Enemy of the World already existed in the BBC archive."
24467337,XSum,"The Nigerian discovery of episodes one, two, four, five and six complete the story.
Episode one of fan favourite The Web of Fear existed, with the rest thought lost forever."
24467337,XSum,"Now episodes two, four, five and six have been recovered.
Episode three is still missing, but has been reconstructed from stills to enable restored versions of both stories to be made available for sale via download on Friday.
The latest find means that the number of missing episodes of Doctor Who has dropped from 106 to 97.
One episode from each story - both last seen in 1968 - were shown at a special event in London on Thursday by BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm.
Among the guests were actors Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, who played Troughton's Tardis companions Jamie McCrimmon and Victoria Waterfield.
Episode one of The Enemy of the World is a James Bond-style thriller complete with an exploding helicopter, a hovercraft, gun-toting henchmen and a foreign-accented villain, Salamander (also played by Troughton).
The story opens with the Tardis arriving on an Australian beach where the Doctor strips to his long johns and goes for a dip in the sea.
The Web of Fear is a claustrophobic tale that sees the Doctor battle his old foe, the Great Intelligence, and the yeti in the tunnels of the London tube system.
""It's the quintessential Doctor Who story,"" said Gatiss."
24467337,XSum,"""It has the return of the Abominable Snowmen in an iconic location.""
He said it showed Troughton ""at the height of his powers"".
Frazer Hines recalled that the underground station sets had been so realistic that London Transport accused the BBC of filming at a tube station in secret.
The story also featured an appearance by Deborah Watling's real-life father Jack, reprising his role as Professor Travers.
Recalling Troughton's ""wonderful sense of humour"" on set, Watling said: ""We all got on so well, we were like a family and Pat was always to me like another dad or an uncle."
24467337,XSum,"We had a chemistry and I think it showed.""
How did she feel when she heard about the recovery of the lost episodes? ""I couldn't quite believe it."
24467337,XSum,There had been hoaxes before.
24467337,XSum,"I thought it was just another hoax.""
Her only other complete story in the archive had been The Tomb of the Cybermen, all four instalments of which were discovered in Hong Kong in 1991.
Hines said: ""This now gives me hope that more stories of Patrick's will come out of the woodwork.""
The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday."
24467337,XSum,"A special episode featuring the current Doctor, Matt Smith, and his predecessor, David Tennant, will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November."

25445297,XSum,But Gandhi was hardly a foe of the West.
25445297,XSum,"He counted three white men - Henry Salt, John Ruskin and Leo Tolstoy - as his mentors, wept when London was bombed during World War Two, and even hired Indians to fight in World War One.
He also spent nearly two decades - 1893 to 1914 - of his formative years in a foreign land - South Africa - where much of his time was spent as a lawyer and an activist.
Gandhi arrived in a deeply divided and inequitable South Africa, carved up into separate colonies, ruled by British expatriates and Afrikaners of Dutch descent."
25445297,XSum,"It was populated also by native Africans and Indian indentured labourers and professionals.
In this ""strange scenario"", writes historian and author Ramachandra Guha, Gandhi acquired, honed and practised his four major callings - freedom fighter, social reformer, religious pluralist and prophet."
25445297,XSum,"He led protests against racial laws, reached out to different communities, forged friendships with dissident Jews and Christians and mobilised expatriate traders.
Guha has recently published Gandhi Before India, his magisterial new book on how South Africa changed the ""earnest naive lawyer"" to a ""smart, sagacious and focused thinker-activist""."
25445297,XSum,"I spoke to him on how much Gandhi remained relevant in today's world:
You write Gandhi's ideas have survived."
25445297,XSum,"Can you give us some recent examples?
In India, the most important and influential of Gandhi's ideas is one we affirm everyday without recognising it comes from him - our constitutional commitment to linguistic pluralism and diversity.
That we are not (or not yet) a Hindu Pakistan is also owed in some part to his legacy.
It is true that in their practice many politicians repudiate Gandhi.
Yet outside politics, in the sphere of social activism for example, he remains an inspiration.
The work of [social activists like] Ela Bhatt and Sewa or of Abhay and Rani Bang, is moderately well known; there are hundreds of such individuals and groups, who work away from the public gaze, in the fields of rural health care, women's empowerment, environmental restoration, all inspired in lesser or greater degree by Gandhi.
But if Gandhi's ideas have indeed survived, are they relevant in today's age? If so, how?
In my view, four aspects of Gandhi's legacy remain relevant, not just to India, but to the world.
First, non-violent resistance to unjust laws and/or authoritarian governments.
Second, the promotion of inter-faith understanding and religious tolerance.
Third, an economic model that does not rape or pillage nature.
Fourth, courtesy in public debate and transparency in one's public dealings.
A curious testimony to Gandhi's continuing relevance is the continuing vehemence of the attacks on him by radicals of left and right."
25445297,XSum,Hindutvawadis [hardline Hindus] detest him - as some of the commentary on blogs and Twitter reveals.
25445297,XSum,"Do you think diasporic nationalism has become rather controversial now as it is often identified with right-wing Indian nationalism?
The Indians in South Africa came from a variety of class backgrounds.
The struggles Gandhi led a hundred years ago first drew support from merchants, but later it was workers and hawkers who sustained it.
On the other hand, the Indian diaspora you refer to, based in the United States, is middle and upper class."
25445297,XSum,"And a solid source of support for Hindutva (Hinduness).
It is not clear whether economic privilege explains political reaction, however, or whether there are more complex psychological processes at work here.
You say Gandhi returned to India in 1915 fully formed and primed to carry out his different callings on a wider social and historical scale."
25445297,XSum,"At the same time, you say Gandhi around that time was essentially a community leader, who represented the interests of about 100,000 Indians in South Africa."
25445297,XSum,"So how did Gandhi transcend this?
Gandhi never intended to permanently stay overseas.
He came back in 1901 to try afresh at the Bombay Bar."
25445297,XSum,"Going back to South Africa a year later, he still hoped that when the rights of Indians in the Transvaal were secured he could return home.
In the event he stayed on till 1914, but for some time prior to that, had been urged by his closest friend Pranjivan Mehta to make a political career in India.
In retrospect, perhaps he (and we) were lucky that he stayed on as long as he did, since it allowed him to develop his social and political ideas, and emerge as an independent leader in his own right."
