            "Subsequently, however, renewed complaints were made by the inhabitants as to the nuisance they experienced as to what was going on at this house, which was frequented by low characters of French nationality, who brought men home with them at all hours, and in the warm season the inmates of the house ware very indelicately attired, and as the windows in the upper part of the house were thrown wide open, the inhabitants occupying houses on the opposite side were greatly scandalized thereby, and one of them, a professor of music, who received pupils, was compelled to keep his blinds down throughout the day in consequence of the scenes that were going on.",

            "Mr. Burrows then handed that sum over to the prisoner, who gave him the plans and specifications.",
            "Mr. Burrows, making sure that he would have the completion of the job, went down to look at the carcases of the houses, when he found that the plans were extremely faulty and erroneous, there being now bow windows in them, and it was evident that they had not been prepared from a view of the houses.",

            "She then appeared to be in her usual health, both bodily and mentally.",

            "On reaching the house they heard a splashing in the bathroom.",
            "They proceeded thither, and found Mrs. Hibbert in the bath.",

            "She took them into a bedroom where the two small children were found lying quite naked on the bed, and although the bodies were warm, they were perfectly dead.",
            "Mrs. Hibbert also told them she had been trying to drown herself in the bath for the last half hour.",

            "From the statement of Mr. Poland it appeared that for some years past the prisoner was the occupier of a house, No. 12, Market Place, Oxford Street, on the site of the old Oxford Street Market, and complaints were made to the vestry as to the manner in which this house was conducted.",
            "On the outside of the house was written up \"Jules de Bodt, cabinetmaker,\" and also \"Madame de Bodt, French laundry,\" and in consequence of the complaints which were made as to the conduct of the house an officer of the vestry in October, 1881, called upon the prisoner and warned him to discontinue the practice of what he was then doing, for if it was continued the vestry would be forced to take proceedings and put the law in force against him.",
            "Subsequently, however, renewed complaints were made by the inhabitants as to the nuisance they experienced as to what was going on at this house, which was frequented by low characters of French nationality, who brought men home with them at all hours, and in the warm season the inmates of the house were very indelicately attired, and as the windows in the upper part of the house were thrown wide open, the inhabitants occupying houses on the opposite side were greatly scandalised thereby, and one of them, a professor of music, who received pupils, was compelled to keep his blinds down throughout the day in consequence of the scenes that were going on.",
            "Witnesses having been called in support of this statement, the jury found the prisoner guilty.",

            "From the statement of the learned counsel on behalf of the Treasury, it appeared that a most extraordinary system of fraud had been practised, there being no less than six prosecutors.",
            "One of those was a Mr. George Burrows, a builder, residing at Chingford, who saw an advertisement asking for tenders for the finishing of four small houses on the Chingford Station Estate.",
            "Mr. Burrows called at the address named, Langham-place, Regent-street, where he saw the prisoner, who spoke to him regarding a letter which he had addressed to him.",
            "The prisoner then said that he would supply plans and specifications, but would first require a deposit of two guineas, which, in the event of his tender not being accepted, would be returned.",
            "Mr. Burrows then handed that sum over to the prisoner, who gave him the plans and specifications.",
            "Mr. Burrows, making sure that he would have the completion of the job, went down to look at the carcasses of the houses, when he found that the plans were extremely faulty and erroneous, there being no bay windows in them, and it was evident that they had not been prepared from a view of the houses.",
            "The prosecutor complained of this, but could not get one penny of his money back.",
            "The other cases were of a similar character.",

            "Subsequently, however, renewed complaints were made by the inhabitants as to the nuisance they experienced as to what was going on at this house, which was frequented by low characters of French nationality, who brought men home with them at all hours, and in the warm season the inmates of the house ware very indelicately attired, and as the windows in the upper part of the house were thrown wide open, the inhabitants occupying houses on the opposite side were greatly scandalized thereby, and one of them, a professor of music, who received pupils, was compelled to keep his blinds down throughout the day in consequence of the scenes that were going on.",

            "Jules de Bodt, a Frenchman, was indicted for keeping a disorderly house in the parish of St. Marylebone.\n",
            "From the statement of Mr. Poland, it appeared that for some years past the prisoner was the occupier of a house, No. 12, Market Place, Oxford Street, on the site of the old Oxford Street Market, and complaints were made to the vestry as to the manner in which this house was conducted.\n",
            "On the outside of the house was written up \"Jules de Bodt, cabinetmaker,\" and also \"Madame de Bodt, French laundry,\" and in consequence of the complaints which were made as to the conduct of the house, an officer of the vestry in October, 1881, called upon the prisoner and warned him to discontinue the practice of what he was then doing, for if it was continued the vestry would be forced to take proceedings and put the law in force against him.\n",
            "I Subsequently, however, renewed complaints were made by the inhabitants as to the nuisance they experienced as to what was going on at this house, which was frequented by low characters of French nationality, who brought men home with them at all hours, and in the warm season the inmates of the house were very indelicately attired, and as the windows in the upper part of the house were thrown wide open, the inhabitants occupying houses on the opposite side were greatly scandalised thereby, and one of them, a professor of music, who received pupils, was compelled to keep his blinds down throughout the day in consequence of the scenes that were going on.\n",
            "Witnesses, having been called in support of this statement, the jury found the prisoner guilty.\n",
            "The learned judge ordered him to pay a fine of \u00a350, and to enter into his own recognisances of \u00a350, and to find two sureties of \u00a325 each, or one surety of \u00a350, for his good behaviour for twelve months.\n",
            "FRAUDS UPON BUILDERS.\n",
            "-Edwin Samuel Boosey, thirty-seven, surveyor, was indicted for having obtained by false pretences various sums of money from divers persons with intent, in each case, to defraud.\n",
            "From the statement of the learned counsel on behalf of the Treasury, it appeared that a most extraordinary *system* of fraud had been practised, there being no less than six prosecutors.\n",
            "One of those was a Mr. George Burrows, a builder, residing at Chingford, who saw an advertisement asking for tenders for the finishing of four small houses on the Chingford Station Estate.\n",
            "Mr. Burrows called at the address 3, Lamb's-place, Regent Street, where he saw the prisoner, who spoke to him regarding a letter which he had addressed to him.\n",
            "The prisoner then said that he would supply plans and specifications, but would first require a deposit of two guineas, which, in the event of his tender not being accepted, would be returned.\n",
            "Mr. Burrows then handed that sum over to the prisoner, who gave him the plans and specifications.\n",
            "Mr. Burrows, making sure that he would not have the completion of the job, went down to look at the carcasses of the houses, when he found that the plans were extremely faulty and erroneous; there being now bow windows in them, and it was evident that they had not been prepared from a view of the houses.\n",
            "The prosecutor complained of this, but could not get one penny of his money back.\n",
            "The other *e* cases were of a similar character.\n",
            "The jury, without retiring, returned a verdict of guilty.\n"

            "AT the Thames police-court, Charles Mawzi was charged with willfully and maliciously setting fire to the house, 2 Caroline-street, Commercial-road East.",
            "At a quarter to four o'clock that morning Lilly, a constable, No. 332 K, was on duty in Caroline-street, when he met the prisoner, and he said, \"I have just come from a fire,\" alluding to a conflagration in Philpot-street, Commercial-road, \"and there is another one up the street, close to the brewery.\"",
            "Lilly caught hold of him, and found that his coat and hands were covered with whitewash, and on being asked to account for it he said, \"I have just come from a fire; I'll show you where it is.\"",
            "On reaching No. 2, which is an unoccupied house, prisoner pulled open the shutters and said, \"Can't you hear the fire now?\" and Lilly then heard the crackling of wood.",
            "He sprang his rattle, and William Gadd, sergeant, 23 H, and Alfred Ford, 358 K, came up.",
