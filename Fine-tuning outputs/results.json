            "EDWARD PRING, twenty-seven, carpenter, was brought up on remand at the Greenwich Police-court, charged with stealing jewellery to the value of \u00a3100, the property of Sir Robert Cunliffe, Bart., M.P., of 37 Lowndes street, Belgravia.",
            "Chief Inspector Phillips said there were a number of charges against the prisoner, all the robberies alleged being under similar circumstances.",
            "The prisoner was taken into custody, it appeared, on a charge of stealing a watch, and other articles, value \u00a312, from the residence of Miss Keene, 8 Belgrave terrace, Lee.",
            "The prisoner called at the house and represented that he had been sent by the landlord to see to the blinds.",
            "He was given access to the bedrooms, and after he had gone a watch, two rings, and two lockets were missed.",
            "His statement of having been sent to the house was found to be false.",
            "The prisoner was ultimately arrested on this charge, and he was subsequently charged with the robbery from Sir R. Cunliffe's upon information given by a young woman charged before the magistrate with the unlawful possession of a diamond ring.",
            "Robert Wollam, footman to Sir Robert, deposed that on March 23 the prisoner came to the house and said he had come to measure the blinds.",
            "Witness said new blinds were not required, whereupon prisoner said he had been sent to put some new springs.",
            "He was permitted to go upstairs, and witness afterwards let him out at the front door.",
            "The house was being painted.",
            "Sir Robert Cunliffe was sworn, and said a quantity of jewellery was missed on the evening of March 23 by Lady Cunliffe, with whom he had been out during the day.",
            "It was taken from the drawers in her dressing-table.",
            "He had since identified a pair of paste buckles, gold locket, emerald ring, two diamond rings, pair of crystal studs, Normandy cross, single paste buckle, carbuncle locket, pair of earrings, and two other rings.",
            "Other articles of jewellery and a purse containing \u00a34 in gold and a \u00a35 note were stolen.",
            "Jane Pring, mother of the prisoner, proved pledging several of the articles at her son's request.",
            "The prisoner was further remanded for a week.",
            "SERVANTS AND THEIR SWEETHEARTS.",
            "ON Saturday, at the Croydon petty sessions, Percy Davis, alias Gordon, a clerk, and Robert Everett, alias Davenport (two fashionably-attired young men, of 47 Auckland-road, Vauxhall), and Elizabeth Williams described as a general servant, were charged on remand with being concerned together in stealing from the dwelling-house, 3 Prior-terrace, St. James's road, Croydon, since October 1881, two gold chains, two diamond rings, two cameo brooches, two gold seals, three gold pins, some silver forks and spoons, and about \u00a320 in silver money, the property of Mary Ann Cosens, valued altogether at about \u00a350; and Robert Everett, father of the prisoner of that name, was charged with receiving the property well knowing it to have been stolen, and he was further charged with unlawfully pledging the same.",
            "The last-named prisoner was for some years a superintendent in the Dorsetshire constabulary.",
            "Mr. Young, who appeared for the prosecution, said that his client, Mrs. Cosens, was an invalid lady eighty-two years of age, and quite unable to attend the court owing to her infirmity.",
            "In September last she engaged the female prisoner as a confidential servant and attendant, and she was the only person who had access to the jewellery.",
            "Short after entering Mrs. Cosens' service she formed the acquaintance of the prisoner Davis, and at the time under the pretence of paying his addresses to the girl, he gained admission to the house, and there was no doubt that he had made the place his home.",
            "He had evidently slept on the premises, and enticed the girl to steal her mistress's jewellery, which he took away and pledged, and spent the proceeds about the town; Everett shortly afterwards came upon the scene, and carried out the same kind of proceeding, Emily Barlow, cook to the prosecutrix, stated that the prisoners first came to the house in soldiers' clothes, which they afterwards exchanged for civilian dresses.",
            "They used to get up to breakfast about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and helped themselves to dinner, the witness cooking the meat purchased out of her mistress's money.",
            "Davis was apparently courting Williams, and a servant named Smith, aged twenty-three used to visit the house on two evenings in the week, and keep company with Everett.",
            "During the courtship she also slept in the house.",
            "Witness was not aware of the jewellery having been stolen.",
            "Detective Forster was then called to prove the arrest of the elder Everett.",
            "The accused said: - \"My son gave me the things to pledge, as I was better known, and could get more money.",
            "He told me that the articles had been given to him by a relative.\" The case was adjourned, and the prisoners were removed to the House of Detention.",

            "[SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.]",
            "AT the Widnes Police-court Peter O'Loughlin, son of a publican in Railway-street, Widnes, was charged with being drunk and disorderly in Anne-street East on Saturday night; also with assaulting Police-constable John Gamble, and with damaging his uniform to the extent of 2s. 6d.",
            "Ann O'Loughin, a girl about twenty years of age, was charged with assaulting and resisting Police-constable Gamble at the same time and place.",
            "Mr. Knowles, solicitor, Widnes, defended both prisoners.",
            "It appeared from the evidence of Police-constables Gamble and Middleton, the former of whom had his head enveloped in a surgical bandage, that on Saturday night the male prisoner was drunk and disorderly in Ann-street, and the constables went to him and told him to go away.",
            "He refused, and was then told that if he did not go he would be locked up.",
            "He replied that no \"bobby\" in Widnes could take him.",
            "He was taken into custody, and while Gamble was endeavouring to put the handcuffs on him, prisoner beat and kicked him, and tore his trousers.",
            "At this juncture the female prisoner came forward, and said to her brother, \"No, Peter, don't go with them; don't go with them.\"",
            "After they had proceeded a short distance Gamble received a severe blow on the back of the head, cutting it open, and causing him to lose a great quantity of blood.",
            "While the constables were struggling with the male prisoner Police-constable Middleton said he saw the female prisoner throw the stone which struck Gamble.",
            "She threw several stones besides that one.",
            "Mary Dearden gave corroborative evidence.",
            "For the defence James Mathews, a boy; Miles Sweeney, Thomas Bain, Ann Connolly, and Catherine Riley were called, each of whom swore that all the stones were thrown from the far side of the crowd, and not by the female prisoner at all.",
            "Mr. Knowles made a pathetic appeal to the bench on behalf of the girl, who, he said, was going to America in the course of a few days, and she was discharged.",
            "Her brother was fined 10s. and costs (6s, 6d.), or fourteen days' imprisonment, for being drunk; 20s. and costs (9s. 6d.), or one month's hard labour, for the assault upon the constable; and 10s. and costs (4s. 6d.) and the damage, 2s. 6d., for injuring the constable's trousers, or fourteen days' imprisonment \u2013 making two months in all.",
            "Mr. Knowles asked the bench to give the prisoner a short time to pay the total amount in, but this was peremptorily refused.",
            "SHOT FIRING IN MINES.",
            "AN important case came on at the Gateshead County Police-court on Saturday, proceedings having been taken by the Home Office against the manager of the Usworth Colliery, for illegal shot-firing on March 2nd, the day on which the disastrous explosion, by which forty-two lives were lost, occurred at that colliery.",
            "The summons was issued against Mr. A. S. Palmer, who was present, as agent of the colliery.",
            "Mr. Arnold Morley, M.P., presented on behalf the Crown, and Mr. R. F. Cooper, Newcastle, appeared for the owners.",
            "Mr. Morley said the prosecution was taken under 35 and 36 Vic., chap. 76, of the Mines Regulation Act.",
            "With regard to the use of gunpowder, it was provided that it should only be used in cartridges, and not within three months after any inflammable gas had been found in the mine.",
            "The prosecution relied in this case of the fact that inflammable gas had been found in the mine within three months of the firing of the shot, and the question was whether the regulation had been complied with, it being requisite under the Act for some competent person duly appointed for that purpose to examine the place where the shot was to be fired immediately before the firing, and not to allow it to be discharged except it was safe to do so.",
            "It was also provided that persons ordinarily employed in the mine were to be out of it or that part of it where the explosive was to be used.",
            "Mr. Cooper said he did not dispute that gas had been found, but it was not found within the conditions of the Act.",
            "He was prepared to prove that it was due to a temporary stoppage in the ordinary ventilation appliances, and was removed when the ventilation was put right.",
            "After evidence had been given on both sides, it was agreed between Mr. Morley and Mr. Cooper that the question at issue was really a legal one as to the meaning of the Act with regard to the conditions under which shot-firing should not take place.",
            "The Court was, therefore, asked not to give its decision, but to adjourn the case until the legal question had been referred to a superior court.",
            "The case was adjourned accordingly.",
            "THE POISONING CASE IN FRANCE.",
            "THE trial of Pel on the double charge of poisoning his first wife \u2013 his second is still living \u2013 and a servant who was also his mistress, has resulted in a verdict of guilty against the prisoner on the second count, although the jury were unable to make up their minds to convict him on the first, notwithstanding the declared presence of arsenic in the exhumed remains of his wife.",
            "Although these were the only two charges preferred against Pel, he is also suspected of having poisoned his mother as long ago as 1872, and of having attempted the lives, in a similar manner, of an old woman named Marie Mahoin and a girl named Eug\u00e9nie Meyer, both of whom were at different times in Pel's service.",
            "The girl Meyer, indeed, who frequently suffered from severe vomiting while she was in Pel's service, has never been seen since Pel announced that she had left him, and it was asserted by the Public Prosecutor during the trial that Pel had poisoned her and disposed of the body, as he is believed to have disposed of that of Elise Boehmer, his servant and mistress, whose case, therefore, is almost parallel with that of Eug\u00e9nie Meyer.",
            "It must be said that Pel's explanation as to what had become of the missing women, and the cause of death of his mother and first wife, were somewhat lame, and although the evidence against him was almost entirely circumstantial, it is scarcely surprising that a verdict of guilty was entered.",
            "There has, however, already been much comment on the fact that the prisoner was practically acquitted of the charge against his wife, whose remains were found to contain poison, and convicted of a charge of which absolutely no trace exists, save some cinders from the stove in which the victim's body is supposed to have been burnt, and which are assumed to be all that remains of her incinerated corpse.",
            "M. Henri Rochefort, in the Intransigent, says that the verdict against Pel is the first instance of a man being found guilty of murder for poison when neither the poison nor the victim's body has been found.",
            "La France calls attention to the fact that the jury gave a negative answer in the case of Pel's first wife, in whose remains distinct traces of arsenic were discovered, and an affirmative answer in the indictment against the prisoner for the murder of Elise Boehmer, although in the latter case the accusation was only supported by medical conjecture.",
            "La France also calls attention to the lamentable defence that was made on the prisoner's behalf.",
            "The Figaro thanks the jury for having resolutely saved society from the possible repetition of similar crimes by bringing in a verdict of guilty.",
            "Pel had been removed to be condemned cell at La Roquette prison.",
            "Since his conviction Pel has displayed more emotion and continues to earnestly declare his innocence.",
            "Pell has been sentenced to death.",
            "COMPENSATION TO A PUBLICAN.",
            "AT the Mansion House Police-court the Metropolitan and the Metropolitan District Railway Companies appeared before the Lord Mayor, M.P., by their representatives, in order that the amount of compensation claimed under 121st section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act by Mr. Dew, the proprietor of the Monument Tavern, Fish-street-hill, might be fixed.",
            "Mr. Grantham said he appeared for Mr. Dew to ask his lordship to assess the amount of compensation to which he was entitled under the 121st section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, in consequence of the railway companies taking possession of his premises for purposes connected with the railway.",
            "When the interest of a tenant was only from year to year the compensation had to be assessed by a magistrate.",
            "The case was a simple one, but had been productive of a great deal of litigation.",
            "The details of the case having been gone into, the Lord Mayor fixed the total amount of the compensation due to Mr. Drew at \u00a3698 4s. 1d.",
            "Mr. Grantham then applied for costs, and the Lord Mayor granted twenty guineas costs.",
            "AT the Cardiff Police-court, on Saturday, Thomas Evans was remanded on a charge of having caused the death of John Collins, on May 27th.",
            "The parties, it was alleged, quarrelled and fought, and Collins fell and Evans knelt on him and then kicked him until he was taken up insensible.",
            "He was taken home, but lingered till Friday, when he died.",
            "Prisoner was remanded for a week.",

            "The circumstances were as follow: Both the defendant and prosecutor are members of the Cocoa Tree Club, in St. James'-street, Piccadilly, and on the 8th of December, 1884, they played at cards there the result being that Mr. Alexander won \u00a31,760 from Mr. Legg, who, as he was losing, said he would only lose \u00a3500, which he was ready at once to pay, provided that any sum exceeding that amount should be played for on a future evening.",
            "They subsequently played a few games, when Mr. Alexander won an additional \u00a3200, and the defendant paid him \u00a3500, the balance standing over.",
            "A few weeks afterwards Mr. Legg, according to his affidavit, heard that Mr. Alexander had been accused of cheating a Mr. Wyndham of \u00a3550 at cards, at the Road Club, in January, 1885, and on the 18th of February the defendant wrote a letter to the committee of the Cocoa Tree Club to the effect that Mr. Harold Alexander had been compelled to resign his membership of the Road Club, having been detected at cheating at cards, and that he was prepared to prove this charge.",
            "This was the libel complained of, and for which he was committed for trial, but was allowed to stand out on his own recognisances of \u00a350.",
            "The matter now came before this court on an application by Mr. Matthews, which was opposed by Mr. Gill, to expedite the hearing of the rule for the certiorari, in order that the trial might take place before the prosecutor had to rejoin his regiment in India.",
            "The Court, disapproving of the course taken by the prosecutor in instituting criminal proceedings in the case of a private squabble, refused the application with costs.",

            "These persons having been committed for trial, there is, of course, nothing to be said as to the propriety of the verdict or the probable result of the proceedings in the higher court.",
            "It may, however, be safely anticipated that whatever the decision of the judge of assize may be, it will provide no security against the repetition of a like catastrophe under similar conditions.",
            "The only guarantee is to be found in the adoption of the recommendation appended by way of \"rider\" to the verdict.",
            "It is the unanimous opinion of the jury that the general use of an automatic brake in all passenger trains is essential for the safety of the passengers, and that therefore the Government ought as soon as possible to introduce a bill compelling all railway companies to adopt this form of brake.",
            "This conclusion was based upon the evidence given at the inquest, and there can hardly be a doubt that it will be confirmed by the report of the Government inspector, whose finding, as Sir Michael Hicks-Beach announced in reply to Mr. Channing, will determine the legislative action of the Government.",
            "The witnesses examined at the inquest, including some of the officials now awaiting their trial, were agreed that if the ill-fated train had been fitted with the improved mechanism the tragedy might, or rather would, have been prevented.",
            "There could not well be a clearer or a more imperative case for the intervention of the Government.",
            "A bill of one clause simply extending the powers of the Board of Trade in the manner suggested would ensure the requisite safeguard to the railway public, and if the business of the House of Commons continues to make progress at the present rate such a measure might be brought in and passed without even disjointing the programme of the Session.",
            "THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE AND THE REPORTER.",
            "IN the Queen's Bench Division, on Friday, before the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Hawkins, Mr. Abinger moved for an order, calling upon Mr. Bridge, the Bow-street magistrate, to show cause why he should not hear and determine an application for a summons applied for by Mr. Simms, described as a reporter, against the Duke of Cambridge, for an assault committed on May 25th, on the occasion of the Prince and Princess of Wales inspecting the Metropolitan Fire Brigade.",
            "On the 28th Mr. Bridge suggested that the case was one for the County Court, but the complainant did not accept the suggestion, and went on to make his complaint.",
            "The information was read, but not sworn, the learned magistrate refusing to allow it to be sworn, and he declined to grant a summons.",
            "In the information the applicant stated the details of the alleged assault, which took place at the Horse Guards, Whitehall.",
            "An affidavit to a similar effect was also read by the learned counsel, who contended that all the elements of an assault which it was possible to bring were present.",
            "After arguments, Lord Chief Justice Coleridge said that it was of the greatest importance that the public should be satisfied that before the law all subjects of the Queen are equal.",
            "He had not a shadow of opinion as to what might be the issue of the case, but it was clear to his mind that Mr. Bridge had not exercised his discretion, which he was bound to exercise judicially, and therefore the rule must be granted.",
            "Mr. Justice Hawkins concurred.",
            "Mr. Abinger asked whether the rule would be nisi or absolute.",
            "Their lordships pointed out that at present they had only heard Mr. Abinger, and the magistrate might have an explanation.",
            "Rule nisi granted.",
            "AT the West Bromwich Police court, on Friday, a man named Thomas Francis Sinclair was remanded on a charge of attempting to murder George Williams.",
            "The men slept together, and on Wednesday the accused is alleged to have jumped out of bed, and to have fetched a knife and stabbed Williams.",
            "It has been stated that both men were in love with the same girl, and that the deed arose out of jealousy, but the girl indicated denies the story.",
            "A LUNATIC patient, named Harris, in the Royal Naval Hospital at Great Yarmouth, made a violent attack on Friday morning upon two other patients, named Miller and Parkes, with a red-hot poker.",
            "Both lie in a very dangerous state.",
            "Dr. Browne, one of the hospital doctors, had his head and arm injured in trying to disarm Harris, and Mr. Cummins, who eventually wrested the poker from the man, had his hands burned.",
            "An official named Kelly also received a terrible blow on the liead.",
            "A GANG OF YOUTHFUL BURGLARS.",
            "AT the Dalston Police-court Frederick Bushell, fifteen, boot finisher, of Crozier-terrace, Hackney; James Arnold, fourteen, errand boy, of Oswald-street, Hackney-wick; and Noah Dunkley, twelve, school-boy, of Overberry-road, Hackney-wick, were charged on remand with being in a disused oilcloth factory in Glyn-road, Clapton-park, supposed for the purpose of committing a felony.",
            "The boys were found in the building at ten o'clock on the previous Saturday morning.",
            "They had evidently made the place their home.",
            "The elder boy was armed with a catapult, and in his possession were a number of lead pellets.",
            "The extensive building had been almost stripped of its piping, and there were evidences that the lead so obtained had been melted down to make pellets for the catapults, which were used to shoot the numerous birds nested in the roof of the building, which were afterwards cooked and eaten.",
            "On the house where Arnold resided being searched a chisel fashioned like a burglar's \"jemmy\" was found, together with a silver-plated teapot and cream jug, and several plated spoons, which it was ascertained had been stolen from a house in Percy-terrace, Mandeville-street, Clapton.",
            "The owner was not present, and Constable 208 J said there was no further evidence to connect the prisoners with the robbery at that house.",
            "A solicitor representing the owner, who is away in Russia, said that during the past few years \u00a3700 worth of damage had been done to the buildings by boys.",
            "A wall eight feet high surrounded the building, and as the inner staircase had long since disappeared he was at a loss to know how the boys got to the top floor.",
            "Arnold said they got over the outer wall from some gardens at the back, and, having forced the windows, they climbed up the beams to the top floor.",
            "The solicitor added that great danger might arise to adjoining property by the boys kindling fires on the floor.",
            "The boys seemed to have been neglected by their parents, one mother admitting that she had taken a situation as a house keeper and left the boy to shift for himself.",
            "Mr. Corser said Bushell appeared to be the ringleader, and he probably had led the other boys away.",
            "He would have ten days' imprisonment and be detained for five years in a reformatory.",
            "The younger boys would go to the workhouse for a week, and Mr. Hiscocks, the School Board officer, would find industrial schools for them.",
            "ACTION FOR LIBEL.",
            "THE hearing of the case of Jones v. Stewart and Co., Limited, Ross and Major was resumed and concluded in the Lord Mayor's Court on Saturday.",
            "The plaintiff, Mr. G. C. Jones, a journalist, sued the defendants, who are respectively the publishers, editor, and contributor to the Agnostic Journal, to recover damages for an alleged libel upon him contained in an issue of March 2^(nd) last.",
            "It appeared that all the parties had formerly been friends.",
            "A book entitled \"The Life of Charles Bradlaugh, M.P.\" was brought out under the name of Mackay, but Mr. Bradlaugh sued Ross and Mackay for libel.",
            "In that action the present plaintiff gave evidence of Mr. Bradlaugh, and the result was that an injunction was obtained against the publication of the work.",
            "The alleged libel then appeared in the journal, in the form of a letter written by Major, imputing that the plaintiff acted from sinister motives, also that he had deserted his colours in giving evidence, and that after attacking Mr. Bradlaugh violently in pamphlets he had turned round and acted like a \"splenetic weathercock.\"",
            "The plaintiff denied this imputation.",
            "No evidence was called for the defence, and the jury found for the plaintiff for \u00a330.",
            "ON Friday an occurrence, almost without precedent, happened at Leigh, a village near Sherborne.",
            "A farmer, named Charles Perris, found that his bees were swarming, and he proceeded to \"take\" them.",
            "He, however, neglected the usual precautions of covering his face, and one of the bees entered his mouth.",
            "The insect settled in his throat, and stung the unfortunate man so severely that he died from suffocation, caused by the swelling, in a few minutes.",
            "AT the Clerkenwell Police-court, on Monday, John Lindsey, forty, a carpenter, of Ansell-street, Fulham was charged with violently assaulting John Robert Burrows.",
            "The complainant, a ticket collector in the employ of the Metropolitan Railway Company, was collecting tickets at the Farringdon-road Station late on Saturday night, when prisoner asked him when the next train left for Hammersmith.",
            "Witness told him, and Lindsey said, \"You might be civil, you drunken fool.\"",
            "Burrows said he had answered civilly, and remonstrated with the prisoner for speaking to him in that way, when Lindsey struck him a heavy blow in the face, severely blackening one of his eyes.",
            "The prisoner, in defence, said he believed the complainant was drunk at the time.",
            "The complainant made him angry by answering his question very sharply.",
            "Witnesses were called for the prosecution, who said that the complainant was perfectly sober.",
            "Mr. Haden Corser ordered Lindsey to pay a fine of \u00a34, and \u00a31 costs, in default to be imprisoned for a month.",
            "CHARGE AGAINST A MANAGING DIRECTOR.",
            "ON Monday, at the Central Criminal Court, Mr. Henry William Pound, late managing director of a limited liability company, called Pound, Son, and Hutchings, now in liquidation, surrendered to take his trial for unlawfully obtaining timber of the value of \u00a34,000, by false pretences.",
            "The prosecutors in this case were Messrs. Brinsmead and Co., pianoforte manufacturers and timber merchants.",
            "The company of which the defendant was the managing director was formed for the purpose of carrying on the business of timber merchants and packing-case makers.",
            "At the close of last year, they had entered into extensive contracts with the Government for the supply of packing cases and ammunition boxes to the War Office.",
            "Messrs. Brinsmead had supplied considerable quantities of timber to the company, and they were desirions to have some additional security for payment.",
            "An arrangement, it appeared, was then made, the terms of which were that whenever the company had sent in to the War Office packing-cases and boxes they should be supplied with timber to a corresponding amount by Brinsmead and Co., bills being given by the company for the amount.",
            "The allegation on the part of the prosecution was that from time to time the defendant represented that large quantities of cases had been delivered to the War Office, and thus fresh supplies of timber were obtained by the company, the fact being that no such goods had been supplied to the War Office, and in the month of March last the company went into liquidation, which led to the discovery of the alleged fraud.",
            "It appeared, however, that the contracts entered into by the company with the Government were really valuable contracts, under which the defendant's company would have derived considerable profit, and that but for the winding-up of the company by an adverse creditor, the supply of cases at the War Office would have continued to go on, and the prosecutors would, in all probability, have received full payment.",
            "It also appeared that everything that was done by the defendant in the matter was done in his capacity of managing director on behalf of the company.",
            "It was also elicited in favour of the defendant that at the time of the winding-up goods of the value of \u00a3500 were ready for delivery by the company to the War Office.",
            "Witnesses were called for the defence, whose evidence went to show that the company was using every exertion to carry out the contracts, and that no fraud was contemplated.",
            "The jury found the defendant guilty, but not with intent to defraud, and strongly recommended him to mercy.",
            "Mr. Gill reminded the court that the defendant had lost everything he possessed, or he would, by his connection with this company, and he never intended to commit any fraud.",
            "The recorder allowed the defendant to be discharged upon his entering into a recognizance to appear and receive judgment if called upon.",
            "SHOWMEN AND THE COUNTY COUNCIL.",
            "AT the Marylebone Police-court, on Thursday, Henry Hall, of Fleet-road, Hampstead, appeared before Mr. Cooke, on an adjourned summons taken out by Mr. William Smallpeice, district survey or, for putting up five wooden structures or erections of a movable or temporary character without having obtained a licence of the London County Council.",
            "Mr. Freke Palmer, solicitor, defended.",
            "Mr. Smallpeice, in reply to the magistrate, said the structures consisted of canvas booths, a steam roundabout thirty feet in diameter, with a canvas roof, a shooting-gallery with an iron roof and a wooden front, and a travelling caravan.",
            "Most of them were on wheels.",
            "They were close to the property of an adjoining owner.",
            "Mr. Palmer said his client had nothing to do with the show booth, and Mr. Smallpeice withdrew that.",
            "Cross-examined: He supposed it would take a week or a fortnight to get a licence from the County Council.",
            "Mr. Palmer produced an official document to show that the vestry received rates on an assessment which included the land in question, let out for the purpose of swings, &c. Mr. Cooke, in giving his decision observed that he had nothing to do with what the vestry had done.",
            "This was a matter for the County Council.",
            "The mere question of swings was not before him.",
            "He had to decide the question of the erection of a certain building.",
            "It was not necessary that a building should consist of bricks and mortar; it might be constructed of wood.",
            "Nor was it necessary that it should be fixed to the ground.",
            "There were two decisions which bore on this case, that in the case of Quilter and Smart being of considerable importance.",
            "The Act 45 Vic., cap. 14, sec. 13, was very clear: \"It shall not be lawful for any person to erect or set up in any place any wooden structure of a movable or temporary character (unless the same be exempt from the operation of the first part of the Metropolitan Building Act, 1885) without a licence in writing first had an obtained from the Board.\" The Act, therefore, included wooden structures and movable erections in any place whatever.",
            "The object was quite clear-it was to protect against fire.",
            "There were certain exemptions in the Act, but these structures did not come within that category.",
            "Of course, a mere polo put up for children to swing round it would not come within the meaning of the Act, but a steam round-about, with an organ in the centre and a canvas cover over it such as had been described, was certainly a building within the meaning of the Act, for which it would be necessary to get a licence from the County Council.",
            "He should fine the defendant a nominal sum of 20s. with 2s. costs.",
            "Mr. Cooke added that he did not intend his decision in this case to be a side-wind for doing away with fairs; that could be done in quite a different way.",
            "SINGULAR ACTION FOR SLANDER.",
            "I the Sheriff's Court for the County of London, last week, the case of Mary Blaver Bennett (a married woman, suing in respect of a separate estate) v. James Beneys-it being an action for slander-came on for assessment of damages, Before Mr. Under-Sheriff Burchell and a jury.",
            "Mr. Harper, barrister, appeared for the plaintiff, who resides at 6, Waterloo-place, Bromell's-buildings, Clapham; and the defendant, who appeared in person, is a painter, residing in the same neighborhood.",
            "Mr. Harper, in opening the case, declared that the language complained of was of the very worst character.",
            "What the defendant said to the plaintiff was, \"You are a thief, and you have robbed me of \u00a33.\" That was a specific charge, in specific language, but the defendant had not appeared to support it, and judgment had been given against him by default.",
            "But this accusation was not all the defendant said of the plaintiff.",
            "He also said, \"You keep nothing but a house of ill-fame,\" and he even accused her of encouraging his daughters at her house.",
            "It was true that the defendant's daughters did visit the plaintiffs house, but the explanation of that was that, when the mother of the girls died, she commended them on her dead bed to the care of her friend, the plaintiff.",
            "Mary Bennett, the plaintiff, was called, and stated that she had known the defendant as a neighbour for twelve years, and had been a friend of his wife and children.",
            "On May 17th last she met the defendant, and asked to speak to him, but before she could open her mouth he made use of the language complained of.",
            "Up to that time she never had any quarrel with him.",
            "As a result of his charges she had suffered very much in the eyes of her neighbours.",
            "She had been hooted at and pointed at as the woman who took the man's daughters away.",
            "The defendant went into the box and repeated his assertions, but called no witnesses.",
            "He asserted that he had been cruelly treated, and accused plaintiff of making certain assertions with respect to his relations with his late wife.",
            "At last the Under-Sheriff interfered in a particularly vehement speech, with the remark, \"Really, gentleman, the court is being turned into a chamber of horrors.\" The jury eventually found a verdict of \u00a33.",
            "Defendant: I have no money.",
            "The Under-Sheriff: I can't help that.",
            "The law must take its course.",
            "A GREAT FUSS ABOUT NOTHING.",
            "AT the Wandsworth Police-court, on Friday, Joseph Hutnott, a costermonger, of Oak-cottages, Clapham, was charged with disorderly conduct, causing a crowd to assemble, and assaulting Police-constable Palfrey, 477 W, while in the execution of his duty.",
            "An officer stated that on the previous day he saw a procession, numbering about two hundred persons, proceeding along Waterloo-place, being accompanied with a barrow containing two effigies, several men beating trays and saucepans, thus causing considerable uproar.",
            "Mr. Plowden: Did the effigies resemble any prominent personages?",
            "Witness: They were meant for local people.",
            "Mr. Plowden: They were local celebrities? (Laughter.)",
            "Witness: Yes, sir.",
            "He explained that the demonstration was the outcome of an action for slander in the Court of Queen's Bench, the effigies representing the successful parties to the suit.",
            "He desired them to disperse, and the effigies were taken into a yard.",
            "The crowd then congregated in front of the house occupied by the man and woman who were being subjected to this annoyance, and the display of angry feeling and throwing of stones at the front door greatly alarmed the inmates.",
            "Mr. Plowden: Was the prisoner one of the two hundred?",
            "Witness: Yes, Sir.",
            "Mr. Plowden: One only here? The hundred and ninety-nine are not here. (Laughter.)",
            "The constable added that a fire was lit in the garden of the house opposite for the purpose of burning the effigies.",
            "He saw the prisoner carrying the woman effigy toward the fire, but on seeing him he threw it into his face and made off.",
            "The prisoner, in his defence, said he threw the effigy over his shoulder, but not with the intention of striking the officer.",
            "He called a woman, who created some amusement by stating that the effigies wore kid gloves and were filled with straw and little hay.",
            "The constable said if it had been made of something else it might have injured him. (Laughter.)",
            "Mr. Plowden: I see; as it was made of straw it only tickled you. (Loud laughter.) I think there has been a great deal made out of this. I can't say the prisoner was not guilty of disorderly conduct, but it was of the most innocent kind.",

Dear Sir, -You need not trouble about my case. I am innocent of the charge I am accused of. The police can prosecute the body; they cannot follow the soul. I am not afraid to meet my God. Man is the greatest enemy man has got. If the police would try to prevent crime instead of laying traps to create it, there would not be one half the misery in the world there is. \u00a3 s. d. is the god of all classes, parsons not excepted. I am hunted down for trying to do good. My only object, motive, or intention on the 25th of June was to do the dear little children good. For me to come into court with only one witness when they have four, coached and trained for one week before they took action, and another week to complete it; had I the opportunity to go into the witness-box (my mouth is closed) I should not have taken the step I have. Hoping you will read this to the Court, and try to open the way to remove the great obstruction to justice by keeping a culprit's mouth closed in defence of his innocence, believe me, yours respectfully, J.

            "The law on the point was that everyone who contracted to perform certain duties upon which the preservation of life depended, and who neglected to perform those duties, and thereby caused the death of any person, committed the same offence as if he had caused the same effect by an act done.",
            "It would be for the jury to consider what was the state of the man's mind when he was guilty of the offence-in other words, whether the neglect was culpable.",

            "The red light on his engine had just been removed as the special came in sight.",
            "He did not think the driver of the special could have seen witness's light at a greater distance than one hundred and fifty yards, and if the red light had been showing the speed of the special could not have been materially reduced, as it is a light train, and the rails were greasy.",
            "-Evidence was given that the prisoner a few months ago sustained a fracture of the ribs and slight lacerations about the head.",
            "His hours were from a quarter-past nine a.m. to a quarter past seven p.m. in alternate weeks.",

            "They must have it proved that he had been guilty of an act of gross culpability and criminal negligence.",
            "He also argued that the removal of the red light from the tail of the goods train was wrong.",
            "-The judge, in his summing-up, said he failed to see that the prisoner was not guilty of gross negligence, but it seemed to him that two other persons had also omitted to do their duty.",
            "He also complained of the goods traffic being shunted on the main line, and was glad the grand jury had called attention to the matter.",

I told her I could not lend her the money as I had none, and I could not mind the child as I was going out.

            "The severing of the head would enable it to be doubled either under or above the body, and thus the body could be more easily placed in the bassinette.",

            "He was employed in the carpenters' shop, and was working with a gang who were erecting scaffolding in front of an addition to a block of warders' houses, forming one of the lines of such blocks parallel to the Aberdeen turnpike road.",
            "The buildings are partly enclosed by a high stone wall and partly by a wooden fencing.",
            "About a quarter before eight in the morning there was a very thick sea fog hanging over the land-so dense, indeed, that, it is said, objects at one hundred yards' distance were barely discernible, and taking advantage of this Laurie scaled the fencing and got on to the public road.",
            "As soon as he emerged upon the road he was discovered by Graham, the civil guard, who at once loaded his carbine and tried to fire, but the cartridge did not go off.",
            "Before he got it extracted and a fresh one substituted the fugitive was hidden by the fog.",
            "The alarm was at once given, and the warders and the reserve civil guard on duty were ordered out for the pursuit.",
            "Unfortunately for the success of Laurie's exploit the sun shone out and dispelled the fog, and his line of flight was made visible.",
            "One warder got his bicycle, and seeing that Laurie must needs cross the Blackhills-road, sped along it to intercept him.",
            "Those who witnessed the pursuit describe it as very exciting while it lasted.",
            "The people who live at Bellevue Cottage, hearing the whistling of the warders, looked out, but seeing a man in convict dress approaching, they shut and bolted the door.",
            "Laurie, however, did not seek the shelter of a house, but made for the clump of trees behind, and there he was overtaken and held.",
            "He was securely handcuffed with his hands behind, and marched back to the prison.",
            "It is understood that the punishment for an attempt to escape is that the prisoner has a belt of iron riveted around his waist, similar bands being put around his ankles, and these are bound together by heavy chains.",
            "He has to wear these ornaments night and day.",
            "His escapade will likely also reduce his standing from the first class, and in other ways restrict his liberties, besides probably adding to his term of servitude.",

            "They knew his position, writs were pouring in, he was in want of money, and he had done this sort of thing before.",

            "-Clara Brown, aged twenty, servant in the family of Mr. William Robins, Adelphi-terrace, Mile-end, was charged at the Worship-street Police-court with stealing eleven sovereigns, under the following peculiar circumstances: -Mrs. Robins, a very lady-like person, stated that about six weeks since she engaged the prisoner as a general servant, but incautiously neglected to make strict Inquiries as to her character, feeling satisfied with the assurance of a woman with whom the prisoner was lodging, that her friend was all a servant should be.",

            "The most singular part of the affair was this, that the daughter of the prosecutrix, about twelve years of age, admitted to an officer having herself given the prisoner two sovereigns out of the thirteen, consequently a charge of stealing eleven only was entered, and whether the prisoner had incited the young lady to open the box with a false key, or succeeded in enjoining her to secrecy, did not appear.",

Love, the chief constable of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with the following serious offence: -James Rutherford, one of the Society's officers, deposed that yesterday afternoon, in the New Cattle Market, his attention was directed to two horses, amongst others, which appeared to be then in much suffering, were exposed for sale, and which upon examining he found to be glandered.",
            "He (witness) said he bad had ten years' experience in veterinary matters, and he had no hesitation in saying the two horses were badly glandered, and consequently extremely dangerous to other horses that might come in contact with them.",
            "The two defendants admitted that the animals belonged to them, and h therefore thought it his duty to bring them before the magistrate.",
            "Mr. Nice, the veterinary surgeon of the market, stated that his attention had been called by the previous witness to the horses in question, and he found them both glandered, one of them badly so.",

            "What defence had they got to make?",
            "The defendant Birch said he was really not aware the horses were glandered when he sent them to the market, and as to Smith, he was merely acting under his (Birch's) orders.",
            "Mr. D'Eyncourt said the horses were not fit to live, and he wished to know what the defendant intended to do with them.",
            "The defendant Birch said he wished them to go to his horse slaughterer's on the other side of the water.",
            "Mr. Mould (the chief clerk) said there was a horse slaughterer close by, and such horses ought not to be allowed to travel through the streets.",

            "THE DAGENHAM MURDER.",
            "It has already been stated that the grand jury at the Chelmsford Assizes ignored the bill against George Blewett for the murder of Clark, the policeman, as Dagenham, in the year 1846, the learned judge (Mr. Justice Willes), in his charge, having expressed a strong opinion that there was not sufficient corroboration of the evidence of the woman Page to render it probable that the petty jury would convict the prisoner if they should return a true bill.",
            "When the bill had been ignored, Mr. Sergeant Parry, who had been retained to defend the prisoner, applied to his lordship to make an order that he should be discharged, but Mr. Justice Willes declined to do so while the grand jury were sitting.",
            "Having shortly afterwards got through their business they were dismissed, and Sergeant Parry then renewed his application for the release of the prisoner.",
            "His lordship said that, now the grand jury were dismissed the prisoner might be discharged, and he at the same time said that he must state that it appeared to him that the magistrates of the petty sessions who had committed the prisoner for trial, had very properly performed their duty in so doing, and that as the case stood before then they had no alternative but to send the matter to be inquired into.",
            "The grand jury had then to exercise their discretion, and it appeared to him that upon the evidence laid before them, they had done quite right in ignoring the bill.",
            "The prisoner, George Blewitt, was shortly afterwards discharged from the gaol.",
            "There were some very extraordinary circumstances in connexion with the murder of the unfortunate policeman that will be interesting to be made public.",
            "It appears that on the night Clark lost his life the sergeant who had the charge of the beat where he was on duty, and who should have met him at certain spots during the night, had absented himself without leave, and when the murder was discovered and he was called upon to give evidence, he was placed in a very unpleasant position, and in order to clear himself he swore that he had met the deceased in the performance of his duty at a certain spot and at a particular hour, and he induced two other constables belonging to the division to come forward and give similar evidence.",
            "As the inquiry proceeded it became evident that these witnesses had spoken falsely, and at length one of them admitted that the statement he had made was false.",
            "The consequence of this was that a very strong impression was created in the minds of many persons that the unfortunate deceased had met his death at the hands of the sergeant, and this impression was strengthened to a certain extent by the fact, that upon inquiries being made, it turned out that Clark, who was a young man religiously inclined, had on several occasions accompanied the wife of the sergeant to chapel while the latter was on duty, and it was suggested that the murder was the result of jealousy.",
            "Nothing, however, transpired to justify any proceedings being taken upon this charge, and the sergeant and the two constables were committed to take their trials at the Chelmsford assizes upon a charge of wilful and corrupt perjury, and they were eventually convicted of that offence, and sentenced to seven years' transportation.",
            "Shortly after his conviction the sergeant went out of his mind, and has remained in that state ever since, and nothing more transpired relating to the murder until the woman Fage made the statement which led to the committal of the prisoner Blewitt.",
            "It was the opinion of almost every one acquainted with the fact that, if the prisoner had been put upon his trial on the present occasion, he must have been acquitted, in which case he would have been altogether relieved from the charge, but by the course that has been taken, if any evidence should be obtained at a future time to confirm the evidence of the woman Page, it will still be competent to try him for the murder, so that it is not at all improbable that the interests of justice will still be vindicated in reference to this fearful crime.",

            "He disposed of his business for about \u00a31,500, and then entered very largely into railway speculations, being at one period worth about \u00a312,000, but his speculation resulted in a very heavy loss.",
            "This case was before the court a short time since, upon application for certificate, and it was adjourned till this day, for the purpose of investigation, and more particularly respecting the proof of Mr. More for \u00a3614 odd, being a balance of account resulting out of railway speculation.",
            "The bankrupt's debts and liabilities amount to about \u00a310,000, running over a period of about three years, and the assets appear on the balance sheet to be \"property, \u00a3162 9s. 8d.\"",
            "He commenced with a capital of \u00a33.189 14s. 11d., and the losses and expenses amount to about \u00a310,000, the profits being stated at \u00a3285 6s. 6d.",
            "Mr. More, who opposed, had been in business as a spirit merchant in Liverpool, and in 1839 became bankrupt, but owing to some negligence on his own part he did not obtain his certificate until July, 1845, at which period he entered the Liverpool market as a share broker; and he did not know what was the amount of his debts, or the dividend, if any, paid under that bankruptcy.",
            "He was not a sworn broker.",
            "He had not offered to withdraw his opposition upon payment of \u00a3300.",

            "The certificate was dated the 25th of July, and twenty-one days was required for the certificate to remain at the Court of Review.",
            "Therefore, the whole of these transactions upon which the proof was made, took place at a time when Mr. More was an uncertificated bankrupt.",
            "Under these circumstances he (Mr. Lawrance) must submit that Mr. More was not entitled to prove.",

            "Upon going, however, to the office of the official assignee (Mr. Edwards), a bond of Lord Ventry's for \u00a37,000 being mentioned in the bankrupt's proceedings, and the same having been shown to Mr. Ripley, it was concluded that the bankrupt, being the brother of Emanuel Daniells, was his employer, and hence the attempt to prove against this estate.",
            "The bankrupt denied having employed his brother in any such transaction.",
            "-Mr. Lawrance objected to an adjournment under such circumstances, and the court concurred.",

            "Upon the last occasion, also, the bankrupt stated that he had nothing to do with West Riding shares, but it appeared that he had, and he now sought to excuse himself by stating that he was merely an agent.",
            "The objection appeared to be, that the bankrupt had been trading out of his avocation as a trader; and it also appeared that he had been speculating in that which a trader ought not.",
            "In order to show traders that they were not to enter into illegitimate speculation, incurring losses, and then enter into one or two legitimate speculations, for the purpose of coming to this court and being made free of all the debts, the Judgment of the court was that the certificate be suspended for twelve months, with protection from month to month.",

            "Mr. Mathews, on behalf of the prisoner, admitted that his client was not free from blame, in the lax-he might say the scandalous-manner in which the bodies of paupers had been treated, but contended that no sale of the bodies for profit had been made out, and that Hogg, the undertaker, who had access to the dead-house, ought to be placed at the bar rather than his client.",

            "As there is no treaty for the extradition of criminals between this country and the Hamburg authorities, but for the circumstance of the prisoner not being provided with the necessary papers, the police of Hamburg could not have interfered with him; and there is no doubt that the arrest of the prisoner was merely a contrivance to get him into the custody of the deceased officer, that he might be brought to England upon the charge of robbing Mr. Ballantine, and that the proceedings taken to effect this object were, to a certain extent, illegal.",
            "If the judges, upon consideration of the facts, should ultimately come to the same conclusion, the probability is that the capital sentence will not be carried out, but the punishment will be commuted to such an one as would probably have been inflicted if the prisoner had been convicted of manslaughter only.",
            "When the prisoner was informed of the respite, but at the same time told that he must not found any hopes that his life would be ultimately spared, which might prove delusive if the legal point were decided against him, he expressed himself grateful for the respite that was afforded him, and evidently felt the impression that the capital sentence would not be carried out.",

The hum of the excited crowd rose from below, not unlike the noise of a distant waterfall; most instantly the treacherous bars on which the condemned stood swiftly and noiselessly gave way, and he descended like an arrow shot from a bow for a distance of seven or eight feet, the weight of his body making a sickening, deadened sort of sound as he suddenly reached the length of the rope. The fall itself must have killed him. After a few convulsive struggles, of which he was quite unconscious, all was over, Matthew Phibbs was dead. Having hung the usual length of time, his dead body was withdrawn from the public gaze, and buried within the precincts of the prison, in accordance with the sentence of the court, Dr. Lynn inspected the body, and officially reported it dead. It has been estimated that about 10,000 people witnessed the execution. Their conduct was orderly and becoming in a remark able degree. There were 150 constabulary on the ground before the scaffold under the charge of Captain Steker, Sub-inspectors Neynoe and Vallancy, Head-constable O'Donnell, &c. Many of the crowd remained until the body was cut down and placed in its coffin outside the gaol door, after which all dispersed quietly and orderly their several ways.\"",

            "Mr. Giffard, in opening the case to the jury, said that the charge against the prisoner was one of a very serious character, and he was sorry to say that the inquiry was rendered still more painful from the fact that the prisoner was a clergyman of the church of England, and filling a highly respectable position in society.",

Brockelhurst, his bankers at Macclesfield, for 6,000l and he then took further proceedings in Chancery to endeavour to obtain that sum out of the estate of the testator.",

            "The men gave the names of Robert Waller (Wateringbury), John Elliot (of Brighton, a pensioner), and John Honey, Thomas Fowler, William Hammond, Robert Sampson, George Honey, and Thomas Honey, of Merewith and Nettlested respectively, and they were apprehended on the charge of night poaching on lands belonging to Mr. William Cook, of Roydon hall, and with the wilful murder of James Gray, head-keeper of that gentleman.",
            "Captain Ruxton, chief constable of the Kent county constabulary, offered no evidence against the first named two prisoners, who had been apprehended simply because they had broken heads.",
            "Elliott had stated to the constables that he was at the affray and that he did not care what they did to him.",
            "They were consequently discharged.",
            "Captain Ruxton, on applying for the remand of the other prisoners, said he had a strong chain of circumstantial evidence which he did not think it right to go into upon that occasion.",
            "He should merely tender such evidence as might be deemed necessary for the granting of a remand.",
            "The under-keeper, George Sexton, (who was close to the head keeper during the affray), swore that to the best of his belief John Honey was the person who shot the keeper; that Sampson knocked him (Sexton) down, and that George Honey, Thomas Honey, and Thomas Fowler were present and taking part in the affray.",
            "The evidence against Hammond was that some six months since he uttered threats against deceased, and that upon his house being searched a jacket with spots of blood upon it, an old gun, a barrel of a gun, some powder, and a shot bag, together with a portion of a newspaper, containing part of a report of the death and last moments of the late prince consort; a singular coincidence being that the wadding of a gun was found near the spot where Gray fell, which also was a place of a newspaper containing part of a similar report.",
            "They were all remanded for a week.",
            "Hammond was admitted to ball on his own recognizances.",
            "In the other cases bail was refused.",
            "ATTEMPTED MURDER IN OXFORD-STREET.",
            "Ruth Elsden, an unfortunate woman, was charged at Marlborough-street police-court, with attempting to murder Thomas Foskett, potman, at the Duke of York, in Union-street, Oxford-street.",
            "There is little doubt the prisoner was actuated to commit the act from a feeling of revenge, she having, in October last, been charged at this court with two soldiers for an assault on Foskett, when she was committed for seven days in default of paying a fine, and, from the threat she made use of, there is reason to believe that she intended to take Foskett's life.",
            "Joseph Reed, 60 D, said he was called to the Duke of York, and saw the prisoner there, and the man Foskett was sitting on a form bleeding from the head copiously.",
            "The prisoner, said, \"Look here, fatty (the constable is a stout man); so help me God, I did it, and intended to do so.\"",
            "I then asked where the knife was, and the landlord said he had put it away, but afterwards gave it to him.",
            "The knife (a large clasp one) produced is the same.",
            "It had blood on it at the time.",
            "The prisoner had been drinking, but she well knew what she was about.",
            "He then took Foskett to the Middlesex hospital.",
            "He went to the hospital that morning and received the certificate produced.",
            "A certificate as follows was here handed to Mr. Tyrwhitt: - \"Middlesex hospital, Jan. 27. -I hereby certify that Thomas Foskett is a patient in this institution, suffering from a punctured wound of the ear, and la not in a fit state to be removed. -W. N. MARSHALL, house surgeon.\"",
            "Mr. Atherfold, landlord of the Duke of York, Union street, Oxford-street, said he had known the prisoner for some time past as a desperate character, and he had frequently forbidden her to come to his house.",
            "On Saturday night last she came in, and, as the annoyed some of the customers, he told her that If she did not keep quiet he would turn her out, she then said, \"If you do, it will be a--bad job for you, for I have got something in this pocket.\"",
            "The prisoner then said she wanted to speak to him privately, but he told her that he would not.",
            "The prisoner then went into the tap-room, where Foskett, his potman, was about his work, and in about two minutes Foskett came out bleeding, stabbed through the ear.",
            "The prisoner then put the knife on the counter, and he took it up, and when the constable asked for it he gave it to him.",
            "The prisoner then said she meant to do it, and hoped she had \"killed the-.\"",
            "She also said, \"I meant this for you, and will do it when I come out.\"",
            "The prisoner had threatened his daughters on a previous occasion.",
            "Mr. Tyrwhitt remanded the prisoner to see the result of the wound, which, he trusted, would not prove fatal.",
            "DESPERATE ATTEMPTS AT BURGLARY.",
            "Two attempts have recently been made to break into the house of a man named Woodcock, who is seventy-five years of age, and keeps a small grocery shop at Mankinholes, near Todmorden.",
            "The old man and his wife sleep in a bed on the ground floor, in a room lighted by a little old-fashioned window of no great strength, the panes of glass being let into a framework of lead; and one night, about six weeks ago, Woodcock was awoke by a pane of the window being broken, and a hand being thrust through the aperture to unfasten the casement.",
            "The old man told the burglar, that unless the hand were withdrawn he would chop it off, and this threat had the desired effect of frightening the ruffian, and causing him to desist.",
            "On Friday night last, however, a more desperate attack was made by two burglars, one of whom struck the window a blow with something that had the effect of driving in the whole of the glass and framework together.",
            "The burglars then entered the room, and one of them seized the wife, while the other pursued the husband into another room, whither he had gone for a weapon with which to defend himself.",
            "It was a dark night, but the old man got hold of a pair of tongs, and struck the burglar who followed him a severe blow with the heavy end of the tongs.",
            "The next moment the burglar caught him by the throat with one hand, while he endeavoured to strike him with a carpenter's axe with the other.",
            "The grasp of the throat was so severe that it forced blood from the mouth and nostrils of Woodcock, but still the old man succeeded in striking the axe from his assailant's hand by hitting him a blow with the tongs across the wrist.",
            "This caused the burglar to stop and search for the axe, and while he did so Woodcock went through the bedroom and escaped by the window to get assistance from his neighbours.",
            "When he returned with some of his neighbours, it was found that the burglars had decamped, without taking anything with them.",
            "In the room where the struggle bad taken place, a sharp axe and a man's cap were found on the floor.",
            "A good deal of blood was on the floor, some of which it is thought had been shed by the burglar in the struggle.",
            "Woodcock was a good deal exhausted and excited through the encounter, and several of his neighbours remained with him during the remainder of the night, and, from the care taken of him, it is thought that he will recover from the injuries he sustained.",
            "There is reason to believe the police are on the track of the men who entered the house.",
            "EMBEZZLEMENT BY A TRAVELLER.",
            "On Thursday, Robert Simpson, late clerk to Messrs. Lee and Jourdein, the well-known and extensive colliery-owners, was brought up on remand at Bow-street police-court on a charge of embezzlement.",
            "It appears that in September, 1861, the prisoner was engaged by Mr. Jourdein upon very high recommendations to take charge of one of their numerous branch establishments, situate at Putney.",
            "His duties were to superintend the business of the Putney branch; to travel in that locality and take orders from customers; to receive money in payment for coals supplied, and to account for the same in a weekly report, which he delivered to Mr. Jourdein every Monday at the head office of the firm, 9, Lancaster place, Strand.",
            "He was paid a salary of 2l. 8s, a week besides travelling expenses, and he had a house at Putney free of rent and taxes.",
            "Lately Messrs. Lee and Jourdein had discovered that a small sum which was due from a customer had been paid to the prisoner, who had not accounted for it, and, as Mr. Lewis explained, such occurrences were very annoying, as customers felt it to be unpleasant to have accounts sent in again after they had been paid.",
            "Upon calling on the prisoner for an explanation the prosecutors received a letter from the prisoner, acknowledging that during the first eighteen months he had received about 60l. which he had not accounted for, and giving a list of the customers whose payments he had kept back.",
            "In that letter he expressed great regret for his conduct, and begged hard to be forgiven for the sake of his wife and children.",
            "At the former bearing Mr. Lewis observed that Messrs. Lee and Jourdein were most reluctant to prosecute the prisoner, on account of his hitherto excellent character.",
            "He had been for many years well known and highly respected in the neighbourhood where ho resided, and was the very last person they would have thought capable of any dishonesty.",
            "But considering the extent to which they had been robbed, having lost upwards of 3,000l. by the defalcations of clerks during the last two years, they felt they had no course but to give the prisoner into custody.",
            "Mr. Hall said it would be best to take that course in every instance.",
            "-Mr. Lewis said that when appeals were made and letters written similar to that of the prisoner, speaking in a most affecting manner of his wife and children, kind-hearted people found it very much against the grain to act with severity and harshness.",
            "Messrs. Lee and Jourdein had therefore forgiven several dishonest clerks, but they felt that they could not go on in such a course for ever.",
            "Upon the case being called on Thursday, however, Mr. Lewis said that some representations had been made by the prisoner's friends, which induced the prosecutors to believe that a lenient course might properly be adopted.",
            "His friends, it appeared, were willing to send him abroad, and there to find some employment for him.",
            "Hoping that the imprisonment and anxiety he had already undergone might operate as a warning for the future, Messrs. Lee and Jourdein were desirous, with the magistrate's permission, to withdraw from the prosecution.",
            "He wished distinctly to assure the magistrate that they acted thus purely from motives of compassion, and not with a view to any compromise, which, if offered, would have been Indignantly refused.",
            "Mr. Hall discharged the prisoner, observing that he ought to feel deeply indebted to the prosecutors for their kindness.",
            "INCREASE OF INFANTICIDE.",
            "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Bedford held in quests in the board-rooms of St. George's, Hanover square, and Mount-street, Grosvenor-square, into the cases attending the deaths of two children, whose bodies were found as described in the evidence.",
            "In the first case, Colonel William Frederick John stone, residing at 23, South-street, Park-lane, stated that he was walking in Hyde-park at eight o'clock on Sunday morning last, and when about a hundred yards from the Grosvenor-gate towards the Marble arch, he saw a small black leather bag, or reticule, lying under one of the seats.",
            "Without ascertaining its contents, he took it to the lodge-keeper, who did not open it for some time, when to his horror and surprise it was found to contain the dead body of a fine male child.",
            "Dr. William Bloxam said he had examined the body, which was that of a fine male child.",
            "There was very considerable compression of the head and effusion of blood between the scalp and the brain.",
            "He had no doubt the child had respired, and the compression of the head was sufficient to destroy life.",
            "The coroner then remarked on the extraordinary nature of the case, and that it was the first instance he knew of such a bag being used to secrete the body.",
            "-The jury returned a verdict \"That the deceased was found dead in Hyde-park.\"",
            "In the next case, the principal witness was Mr. Inspector Harris, of the London, Chatham, and Dover railway, from whose evidence it appeared that on Saturday midday it was found that one of the water closets in the ladies' waiting-room, at the Victoria station of the above railway, was out of order, and a plumber was sent for, who took the place to pieces, and discovered that the stoppage was caused by a large bundle, which, on being opened, was found to contain the dead body of a female child, which had evidently been placed there by ono of the passengers.",
            "Every inquiry had been made, but no clue to the parties who had deposited the body had been obtained.",
            "It having been stated by Dr. Bloxam that the child did not appear to have been of the full period, the coroner said that, while the offender might be punished for concealing the birth, yet this court could not deal with the case.",

            "The latter, it must be admitted, behaved with great forbearance.",
            "He tried to keep her off and prevent her from striking him, but did not once lift his band to strike her in return.",
            "She flung herself upon him several times with such violence as to fell him to the ground, and while he was down she kicked him in the face and jumped upon his chest.",
            "She tore the hair from his head in handfuls, and held it up for the admiration of the crowd (a laugh).",
            "During a portion of the time that this scene continued a crowd of fully 200 persons was assembled.",
            "When the police arrived at last the prisoners seemed sorry for their conduct and went with the police quietly enough.",
            "This sort of disturbance was of constant occurrence.",
            "Every Sunday afternoon on the closing of the public-houses at three o'clock crowds of thieves and prostitutes poured forth from the public houses, and began brawling in the street.",
            "His main object in attending the court that day was to urge the necessity of some more efficient police protection.",
            "Application had been made to the police, and promise and been made that two constables should be placed on special duty; and yet there was a riot going on for nearly half an hour, and no constable to be seen.",

            "Requiring for this purpose to get out of pawn a coat which his \"wife\" had pledged, he asked her for the duplicate, at the same time telling her she ought not to have pawned it.",
            "Upon that she few into a passion, and attacked him as described.",

            "No doubt it must have appeared to the constable, coming in at the last minute, that they were fighting together; but from the evidence of the second witness it was clear that the man suffered great provocation without retaliation.",

            "They afterwards got into other omnibuses, in one of which the robbery was committed for which they were now charged.",
            "Mr. Montagne Williams, on behalf of Williams, pointed out some discrepancies in the evidence, and said with all his care and intelligence Serjeant Coathorpe had this time made a mistake, and he should set up an alibi and show that Williams was not at the place at the time stated.",
            "The prisoner Slack was then taken out of the dock and put into the witness-box, and he swore that the other prisoner was an entire stranger to him, that he never walked out with him, that he was not with him at the time in question, but a man named Taylor, of Francis street, Tottenham-court-road, was the party who assisted him in the robbery; that Taylor was a different sort of man to the prisoner, and that he had a black moustache and not a light moustache.",

            "He was there from half-past two o'clock until half-past five, and he did not go out during that time.",
            "Two witnesses were here called by Mr. Besley, who stated that they had repeatedly seen the two prisoners together, and although Williams bore a strong resemblance to his brother, who was a notorious thief, they knew them perfectly well to distinguish one from another.",

H. Tunnicliffe (Mrs. Waite's brother) was the father of the infant which she was expecting.",

            "This search caused a great deal of talk in the neighbourhood, and ultimately coming to the knowledge of the prisoner's brother and father, who lived at Chorley, they recollected that the prisoner, who had come home about five o'clock on the morning of the murder, had been dealing with a watch, which, as far as their memory went, corresponded with the watch of the murdered man.",
            "The prisoner had been sent to Dartmoor in the meantime, where he was serving a term of penal servitude for another offence, when he was arrested for this crime.",

            "When gentlemen were summoned on the jury or grand jury at the Lord Mayor's court and did not attend they were fined; and the prisoner seemed to make it a practice to ascertain who the gentlemen were who were fined for non-attendance, and then come forward and make a false affidavit in order to get them excused from the fine.",
            "This had been reduced to such a system that it was found that some gentlemen never appeared in the jury-box at all, while others who did attend to their duties were continually complaining that they were taken away from their business much more frequently than they ought to be in in consequence of the non-attendance of other gentlemen who ought to serve upon the jury.",
            "In the present case he was prosecuting for having committed perjury in making an affidavit which was false, in order to get the fine which had been inflicted on the juror for not attending remitted.",

            "-Mr. Montague Williams, counsel for the complainant, said: Although Major Finney does not appear, it will be necessary to call the complainant; and to prove my case, I think I ought to inform you under what circumstances my unfortunate client became acquainted with the defendant.",
            "He is a major in the South Middlesex militia, and I believe at one time held a captain's commission in the line.",

            "Without further observation, he (the learned counsel) would ask the magistrate to make the usual order of 2s. 6d. a-week for each child.",

            "Mr. Curtis said if he could see a constable he would give him into custody, and he went out to look for one.",
            "He went up West-street and down Gloucester-lane, as far as the Three Horse Shoes inn, but could not see a policeman, and was about to return home when the prisoner, who had followed him, struck him in the face and chest.",
            "The deceased constable, who was in plain clothes, had witnessed the assault, and he came up and collared the prisoner.",
            "He resisted, a scuffle took place, and in the struggle they got into the bar of the Three Horse Shoes.",

            "The internal and external injuries in the region of the abdomen were of a shocking character, and indicated the brutal nature of the treatment to which the poor creature had been subjected before death.",
            "The surgeon was of opinion that the deceased was killed before being put into the water, from the fact that there was no water in the stomach, nor was the brain congealed.",
            "There was a considerable effusion of blood under the scalp on each side, but the brain was not injured.",
            "From appearances he thought the deceased could not have led a very immoral life.",

            "The mass proved to be the burst boiler, weighing several tons.",
            "A body subsequently came to the surface, which proved to be that of the stoker Williams.",

            "In the front part, immediately opposite the mouth, a piece of iron hoop had been placed horizontally to prevent the wearer from getting anything up to her mouth, though this, it appeared, was ineffectual, as, from the mask being rather too large, she had managed during the short time she had it on to turn it round on her head, and drink a small glass of liquor.",

            "His relatives firm in the conviction that, been allowed to plead, they would have been able to convince the jury of his innocence.",
            "The circumstances, they freely admit, were suspicions, but they contend that they were not beyond explanation, and, as to the alleged stabbing of a young lady on Thursday, the 5th of March, they assert that they had evidence that would have shown it to be impossible that it could have been committed by Cutbush.",
            "One strong point in their favour is the statement made by Mrs. Dickinson who has been seen representative of Lloyd's, Mrs. Dickinson keeps a gunsmith's shop in the Minories, close to the Tower of London, and it was there that Cutbush purchased the dagger that was produced at the police-court.",
            "Mrs. Dickinson appears to remember the transaction pretty clearly, and she expresses her conviction that the knife was purchased on Saturday, the 7th March, two days after Miss Johnson was stabbed in the Kennington-park-road.",
            "Cutbush appears to have given two reasons for the purchase of the knife, the first being that he was going on board a ship on which there were some foreign sailors, and the second that he wanted it to protect himself against the men who were after him, meaning, presumably, the men sent by the parochial authorities to convey him to the workhouse.",

            "\"3. It falls heavily on particular classes of property, impounding to an important extent advertisements in journals. In America, any man who wishes to lend or to hire, to buy or to sell, announces his wish, without being subject to any duty, for 1s.",
            "\"4. It acts most injuriously on literary works striving at cheapness. The cost of advertising sometimes amounts to more than the whole profit of author and publisher on works which are successful.",
            "\"5. It is a tax which goes far to fetter the free extension of the press, and prevents the circulation of a sound and wholesome literature among working men. In America there are 850 daily papers, in England there are only ten.",
            "\"6. It creates a monopoly. It is only the comparatively prosperous tradesman who can afford to advertise \u2013the intelligent mechanic is excluded from newspaper publicity.",

            "The deceased was in very reduced circumstances, and had lived in his late lodging nearly three years, during which period he never permitted any person to enter his apartment, no doubt induced from a mistaken feeling of shame at its mean appearance.",
            "His own aspect at all times was exceedingly wretched, and his tattered clothes frequently attracted the commiseration of the neighbours, for it was well known who he was, and his talents were appreciated by those about him, to whom he was in the habit of exhibiting some of the portraits which he painted.",
            "A short time before his unhappy death he spoke to his landlord about being unable to pay his rent, some two or three shillings a week, when the landlord, much to his credit, instead of upbraiding the poor fellow and giving him notice to leave, told him that he might run on as long as he pleased without paying, in the hope that the times would get better with him.",
            "Mr. Smart was last seen alive on Saturday, and his non-appearance from that period up to Wednesday afternoon excited the apprehension of his landlord; the more se, as everything appeared so quiet in the room.",
            "Obtaining no answer to repeated knockings at his door, the landlord at length, with the assistance of the police, forcibly entered the apartment, when a terrible spectacle met their view, as the poor creature's remains, in a fearfully putrefied state, lay stretched on some dirty old rags, which had served for his bed, and there was a deep gash across his throat, which, to use the words of Mr. Strange, the surgeon, who was called to see the body, \"nearly divided his head from the trunk, the wound extending down to the very vertebr\u00e6.\"",

            "Mr. Lund, superintendent of police, stated that on the morning of the 17th he visited the gardens behind the defendant's house, and saw them fitted up in all particulars resembling a fair, with the exception of the absence of wild beasts.",
            "There was a rifle and shooting gallery, two swings, four gingerbread stalls, one wheel of fortune, three wheels for games of chance, a platform for dancing dogs, a show for the performance of canary birds, a tight rope for dancing, a booth called the gallery of illustration, and a weighing and lifting machine.",
            "He sent for Mr. Wale, and told him he was acting in violation of the law and amenable to act of parliament, as the place was a fair to all intents and purposes.",
            "Mr. Wale replied that it was only a \"fancy fair,\" but he (Mr. Lund) advised him to clear the ground, for that a number of his neighbours would be very much annoyed at it.",
            "The defendant replied that he could not do so, and witness then gave directions to the inspector and Sergeant Coppin to keep an eye on it, and he (Mr. Lund) himself had visited it on the different days.",
            "On one occasion, seeing 200 children there under sixteen years of age, he sent for Mr. Wale to speak to him, but he refused to come to him, and the message he sent to him was that if he wished to see him he must come to him.",
            "Besides the charge for admission, additional charges were made for some of the exhibitions on the ground.",
            "For the canary birds an addition was made.",

            "Mr. Elliott (the magistrate) said that there was no ground for considering the place a fair.",
            "Under the provisions of the Police Act the 2nd and 3rd Vic., cap. 47, a fair was a place for the purchase and sale of merchandise, and where a toll was charged, and therefore there was no pretence to call the exhibition described as a fair.",
            "If it was held to be so there would be an end to all sorts of amusements, and the summons against the defendant in this case was dismissed.",
            "Considerable applause followed the decision of his worship, and on its subsiding a gentleman, who represented himself as an inhabitant of the neighbourhood, rose, and representing the place as a most intolerable nuisance, entreated his worship's assistance on his own behalf and on that of his neighbours, to put a stop to or, at least, abate it.",
            "Mr. Elliott replied that all places of amusement must be more or less an annoyance to people in their immediate vicinity; but if the defendant, as a publican, had been guilty of any violation of his licence, he was amenable for it.",

            "As this bit of paper had been evidently dropped by the thief who entered the house, he made inquiries at the fried-fish shop, where he remembered seeing the prisoner Britton, and he then found that the fish-vendor had a large quantity of old Church Reviews, being the same year's date (1875) as the fragment, and found at the prosecutor's house.",

I leave you to judge of that point; but I ask you, as men of sense, whether I should not have gone fifty yards, and in a contrary direction, had been a thief?

            "With regard to the use of gunpowder, it was provided that it should only be used in cartridges, and not within three months after any inflammable gas had been found in the mine.",
            "The prosecution relied in this case on the fact that inflammable gas had been found in the mine within three months of the firing of the shot, and the question was whether the regulations had been complied with, it being requisite under the Act for some competent person duly appointed for that purpose to examine the place where the shot was to be fired immediately before the firing, and not to allow it to be discharged except it was safe to do so.",
            "It was also provided that persons ordinarily employed in the mine were to be out of it or that part of it where the explosive was to be used.",
            "Mr. Cooper said he did not dispute that gas had been found, but it was not found within the conditions of the Act.",
            "He was prepared to prove that it was due to a temporary stoppage in the ordinary ventilation appliances, and was removed when the ventilation was put right.",

            "THE trial of Thomas Pope, on the double charge of poisoning his first wife-his second is still living-and a servant who was also his mistress, has resulted in a verdict of guilty against the prisoner on the second count, although the jury were unable to make up their minds to convict him on the first, notwithstanding the declared presence of arsenic in the exhumed remains of his wife.",
            "Although these were the only two charges, on which Pel was preferred against him, he is also suspected of having poisoned his mother as long ago as 1872, and of attempting the lives, in a similar manner, of an old woman named Maria Mahoin and a girl named Eug\u00e9nie Meyer, both of whom were at different times in Pel's service.",
            "The girl Meyer, indeed, who frequently suffered from severe vomiting while she was in Pel's service, has never been seen since Pel announced that she had left him, and it was asserted by the Public Prosecutor during the trial that Pel had poisoned her and disposed of the body, as he is believed to have disposed of that of Elise Buschler, his servant and mistress, whose case, therefore, is almost parallel with that of Eug\u00e9nie Meyer.",
            "It must be said that Pel's explanation as to what had become of the missing woman, and the cause of death of his mother and first wife, were somewhat lame, and although the evidence against him was almost entirely circumstantial, it is scarcely surprising that a verdict of guilty was entered.",
            "There has, however, already been much comment on the fact that the prisoner was practically acquitted of the charge against his wife, whose remains were found to contain poison, and convicted of a charge of which absolutely no trace exists, save some cinders from the stove in which the victim's body is supposed to have been burnt, and which are assumed to be all that remains of her incinerated corpse.",
            "M. Henri Rochefort, in the Intransigent, says that the verdict against Pel is the first instance of a man being found guilty of murder for poison when neither the poison nor the victim's body has been found.",
            "La France calls attention to the fact that the jury gave a negative answer in the case of Pel's first wife, in whose remains distinct traces of arsenic were discovered, and an affirmative answer in the indictment against the prisoner for the murder of Elizabeth Boehler, although in the latter case the accusation was only supported by medical conjecture.",

            "It is the unanimous opinion of the jury that the general use of an automatic brake in all passenger trains is essential for the safety of the passengers, and that therefore the Government ought as soon as possible to introduce a bill compelling all railway companies to adopt this form of brake.",
            "This conclusion was based upon the evidence given at the inquest, and there can hardly be a doubt that it will be confirmed by the report of the Government inspector, whose finding, as Sir Michael Hicks-Beach announced in reply to Mr. Channing, will determine the legislative action of the Government.",

            "The allegation on the part of the prosecution was that from time to time the defendant represented that large quantities of cases had been delivered to the War Office, and thus fresh supplies of timber were obtained by the company, the fact being that no such goods had been supplied to the War Office, and in the month of March last the company went into liquidation, which led to the discovery of the alleged fraud.",
            "It appeared, however, that the contracts entered into by the company with the Government were really valuable contracts, under which the defendant's company would have derived considerable profit, and that but for the winding-up of the company by an adverse creditor, the supply of cases at the War Office would have continued to go on, and the prosecutors would, in all probability, have received full payment.",
            "It also appeared that everything that was done by the defendant in the matter was done in his capacity of managing director on behalf of the company.",

            "The object was quite clear-it was to protect against fire.",
            "There were certain exemptions in the Act, but these structures did not come within that category.",
            "Of course, a mere polo put up for children to swing round it would not come within the meaning of the Act, but a steam round-about with an organ in the centre and a canvas cover over it such as had been described, was certainly a building within the meaning of the Act, for which it would be necessary to get a licence from the County Council.",

            "What the defendant said to the plaintiff was, \"You are a thief, and you have robbed me of \u00a33.\" That was a specific charge, in specific language, but the defendant had not appeared to support it, and judgment had been given against him by default.",
            "But this accusation was not all the defendant said of the plaintiff.",

If the police would try to prevent crime instead of laying traps to create it, there would not be one half the misery in the world there is. \u00a3 s. d. is the god of all classes, parsons not excepted. I am hunted down for trying to do good. My only object, motive, or intention on the 25th of June was to do the dear little children good. For me to come into court with only one witness when they have four, coached and trained for one week before they took action, and another week to complete it; had I the opportunity to go into the witness-box (my mouth is closed) I should not have taken the step I have. Hoping you will read this to the Court, and try to open the way to remove the great obstruction to justice by keeping a culprit's mouth closed in defence of his innocence, believe me, yours respectfully, -J.

            "Mr. Fenwick said he was sorry he could not allow the statement to go upon the depositions, as it was not germane to the inquiry, but he would certainly direct that the officers mentioned should attend the sessions for the purpose of giving evidence if the Court desired it.",
            "Police-constable 233 here stepped forward, and said he wished to add to his evidence the fact that Inspector Stevens had on more than one occasion reported him, and given him a \"jacketing.\"",

            "About a quarter before eight in the morning there was a very thick sea fog hanging over the land-so dense, indeed, that, it is said, objects at one hundred yards' distance were barely discernible, and taking advantage of this Laurie scaled the fencing and got on to the public road.",

            "They went to St. John's Recreation Ground, where it was alleged the prisoner decoyed the little one away.",
            "Her companions were found on a seat, having been told to wait there till Katie came back.",

            "Gaining admission, he discovered the prisoner, apparently asleep, on the floor with a little girl.",
            "The accused said she was destitute, and at the police-station she told Inspector Bill such a precise and circumstantial story that she was believed and sent with the child as poor wayfarers to Hampstead Workhouse.",
            "She said she ran away from home at Torquay nearly five years ago with a young gentleman named Graham, who promised her marriage.",
            "On her arrival in London she lived with Graham, who deserted her, shortly after her baby was born.",
            "Katie's birthday, she declared was on the 4th February.",
            "After she had gone to the workhouse the Inspector made some inquiries, and learning that a girl had been stolen from Westminster, he communicated with the police of the district.",
            "The result was that the father of the child went to the workhouse and identified her.",
            "The girl, in the presence of the prisoner, repeatedly said, \"This lady took my earrings,\" and she made no answer to the accusation.",
            "On Sunday afternoon, in the police cell, she tried to take her life by tying a portion of an apron tightly round her neck, and then completely covering herself with a rug.",
            "Mr. Sheil remanded her, and there was some hissing from the public as she was removed from the dock.",

            "The Common Serjeant summed up with great detail.",
            "Dealing with the evidence called for the defence, his lordship observed that it could not be disputed but that the prisoners did have some knowledge of eye diseases, although their methods might have had an operation one hundred years ago.",
            "Still there was the fact, which had been deposed to by several witnesses, that the treatment used by the Indians had a beneficial effect, and had given satisfaction.",
            "It was evident that in some of the cases the Indians were not in a position to diagnose the diseases to the eyes from which some of the patients suffered, as, for instance, atrophy of the optic nerve, which required the use of the ophthalmoscope.",
            "No feeling of indignation or of displeasure was manifested against these people until, the prosecution, when everybody seemed to rise in arms against them.",
            "The suggestion of jealousy on the part of the medical profession against these persons was of the wildest stretch of imagination which the learned counsel for the defence could ever have indulged in.",
            "All, he thought, would agree that the action which the society had taken was in the best interests of the community, and perfectly justified by the circumstances under which the conduct of the prisoners presented itself.",
            "The responsibility of the decision of the conduct and behaviour of the men rested with the jury.",
            "Had the prosecution established that these men, either by their conduct or treatment, together with the other circumstances connected with their proceedings, been guilty of conspiring to defraud, and had defrauded, by means of false representations.",
            "In this respect the jury had to say whether the prisoners wickedly and deliberately performed operations which they knew to be perfectly useless, and performed them with the full knowledge that they were unnecessary and cruel, and with the object of fraud.",
            "The jury retired to consider their verdict at fifteen minutes to one.",
            "After an absence of two hours they returned into court with a verdict of not guilty.",
            "The foreman added a rider to their verdict to the effect that they (the jury) deeply regretted that at present there existed no law which would prevent such persons, with the gross ignorance of the prisoners, from practising surgery.",
            "The Common Serjeant (to the Jury): I quite concur in your verdict and the rider which you have added.",

            "AT Manchester Assizes, on Thursday, the case of the Lancashire Reversionary Interest Company v. Day, in which Mr. Monson is concerned, was heard.",
            "Its public interest turned on the fact that defendant, Mrs. Day, is the mother of Mrs. Monson, and among the witnesses was Mrs. Monson herself.",
            "It had some bearing on the Ardlamont matter, as showing the sort of monetary transactions in which Monson was engaged.",
            "The issue of the case, which had reference to a loan of \u00a3600 by the plaintiff company, was briefly whether or not the signature of Mrs. Day was really her signature or a forgery.",
            "One of the clauses of the document which was in question was alleged to be written personally by Mr. Cecil Hambrough, whose death is now the subject of inquiry.",
            "Mrs. Monson's evidence was that on September 19th, 1890, Mrs. Day, her husband, and herself executed the deed in question, and Mrs. Day signed the document.",
            "She was familiar with her mother's hand-writing, and she was also confident that the attesting clause was in Hambrough's writing, with which she was also acquainted.",
            "In her cross-examination Mrs. Monson said that she had occasionally been much troubled for money since her marriage, and her husband had latterly been a good deal in the hands of money-lenders.",
            "The evidence of Monson, which was taken on commission at Edinburgh, was corroborative.",
            "Mr. Yates, on behalf of the defendant, said he did not hesitate to suggest that the signature to the deed was a forgery by Monson.",
            "Mrs. Monson had given evidence against her mother, but they must bear in mind that this case might have an important bearing upon another and a graver case, and when she faced the necessity of sacrificing either her husband or her mother, wife like she stuck to her husband.",
            "Specimens of Lieutenant Hambrough's writing were put, in to but nothing farther of a sensational nature occurred during the hearing of the case.",
            "Mr. Yates, Q.C., addressing the jury on behalf of Mrs. Day, contended that the signature was a forgery.",
            "He asked the jury whether they did not think that Monson, who had forged one deed and was practised in the art, was likely to do it again when he was hard up.",
            "They knew his position, writs were pouring in, he was in want of money, and he had done this sort of thing before.",
            "Mr. Smyley, for the plaintiff, expressed surprise at the audacity of Mr. Yates in stating that Monson had forged other deeds.",
            "No, such thing had been proved, and it was most unfair to bring such accusations against a man over whose head such a serious charge was at present resting.",
            "At the conclusion of counsel's address the jury at once returned a verdict for Mrs. Day.",

            "As the inquiry proceeded it became evident that these witnesses had spoken falsely, and at length one of them admitted that the statement he had made was false.",
            "The consequence of this was that a very strong impression was created in the minds of many persons that the unfortunate deceased had met his death at the hands of the sergeant, and this impression was strengthened to a certain extent by the fact, that upon inquiry being made, it turned out that Clark, who was a young man religiously inclined, and had on several occasions accompanied the wife of the sergeant to chapel while the latter was on duty, and it was suggested that the murder was the result of jealousy.",
            "Nothing, however, transpired to justify any proceedings being taken upon this charge, and the sergeant and the two constables were committed to take their trials at the Chelmsford assizes upon a charge of wilful and corrupt perjury, and they were eventually convicted of that offence, and sentenced to seven years' transportation.",
            "Shortly after his conviction the serjeant went out of his mind, and has remained in that state ever since, and nothing more transpired relating to the murder until the woman Page made the statement which led to the committal of the prisoner Blewitt.",
            "It was the opinion of almost everyone acquainted with the fact that if the prisoner had been put upon his trial on the present occasion, he must have been acquitted, in which case he would have been altogether relieved from the charge, but by the course that was taken, if any evidence should be obtained at a future time to confirm the evidence of the woman Page, it will still be competent to try him for the murder, so that it is not at all improbable that the interests of justice will still be vindicated in reference to this fearful crime.",

            "On Tuesday, considerable excitement prevailed in Peckham and its vicinity from the discovery of the body of a female child in the house of Mr. Whitby, a highly respectable inhabitant of James street, Commercial-road, Peckham, which had undergone the most extraordinary mutilation by the inhuman mother.",
            "It appears that on or about the 10th instant, a young woman, named Mercy Steer, servant to Mr. Whitby, seemed to be in very ill-health, and her mistress conceived that all was not right.",
            "She, however, left her service on the 29th inst., without any elucidation taking place, and proceeded to her native village, a place called Billinghurst, near Petworth, in the county of Sussex.",
            "Having there continued in an ill state of health she found it necessary to obtain medical advice, and the result of which was, that she was found to have been recently delivered of a child.",
            "Giving no satisfactory account of this, the circumstance was communicated to Mr. Hay, one of the churchwardens of Billinghurst, who, having ascertained that Mary Steer had been in service at Peckham, a communication was at once forwarded to Mr. Superintendent Lund, of the P division, who placed the matter in the hands of the police, who proceeded to the house of Mr. Whitby, for the purpose of making an examination.",
            "On searching the chamber which had been occupied by the woman Steer, there at first appeared no indications of any child birth having recently taken place.",
            "A closer inspection, however, showed that the sheets, blankets, and bedding, had been recently washed, with a view to remove any stains, but on the pillows there were some visible traces of blood.",
            "A further search showed some marks on the boards of the floor, to obliterate which, some evident, though ineffectual, attempts had been made.",
            "A closer investigation brought to light a piece of bedside carpeting, saturated with unequivocal marks of a recent child-birth.",
            "This discovery led to a more searching examination, and after removing the pan of the water-closet, the right hand of an infant was discovered on the top of the soil.",
            "Proceeding further in the examination, the various fragments of the body of a newly-born female child were brought forth, but which had been separated into so many minute portions, as to be almost calculated to destroy all traces of the previous existence of any human body.",
            "The object of this mutilation, it would seem, was to force the respective portions through the soil pipe, for which purpose the skull had been divided longitudinally, and the vertebrae had undergone a similar process.",
            "The hands had been amputated at the wrists, and the feet at the ankles, the arms at the elbows, the thighs at the hips, and the abdomen divided into several particles.",
            "As a matter of course, the heart, spleen, and other portions of the intestines were also subdivided.",
            "From a cursory view it would appear that the child was born alive, and must therefore have been subjected to horrid mutilation by the inhuman mother.",

            "-The investigation before the magistrates into the revolting case of attempted murder of a woman on the North Denes, a secluded portion of the sands on the beach to the north of this town, by placing a pitch-plaster over her face, and inflicting dreadful injuries upon her person, was resumed yesterday at the town-hall.",
            "Samuel Howth, the man who is charged with committing the diabolical outrage, on being placed at the bar, seemed little changed since the last inquiry.",
            "Dressed as a labourer, he watched the witnesses giving their evidence very intently, without, however, evincing the least uneasiness or concern.",
            "It has not been remarked that his capture was effected within two hours after the atrocious attempt.",
            "The poor woman, it will be remembered, continued in apparently a lifeless state for some time after she was discovered lying on the sands.",
            "Partly recovering her senses at the hospital, whither she had been conveyed, she named her assailant (the prisoner), thus enabling the police to act promptly in the matter.",
            "Repaying to a house where the family resided, in Yarmouth, they found him sitting by the side of the fire coolly smoking his pipe.",
            "He had divested himself of his slop, stock, and boots.",
            "He seemed perfectly calm and collected, although from his heated appearance it was evident that he had recently been labouring under some unusual excitement.",
            "The life of the unfortunate woman being despaired of by the medical man, and in order that there should be no mistake as to the identity of the accused, the police had him brought to the side of the bed in the hospital, where the victim of his revolting barbarity lay.",
            "When asked by the magistrate present whether she could recognize the person who had committed the outrage upon her, she, after much difficulty and pain, her sight being injured, exclaimed in a terrified tone, \"Oh, yes, yes; there he stands (pointing to the prisoner). Pray don't let him come near me. He thought he had murdered me; he left me for dead.\"",
            "The prisoner heard the accusation unmoved, and in a callous tone replied, \"I know nothing about her, and I call God to witness that I am innocent. You (addressing the magistrate and police) know as much about the woman as I do.\"",
            "At the proceedings yesterday, the examination was somewhat irregularly conducted, in consequence of frequent altercations among the members of the bench-a circumstance, we understand, of no uncommon occurrence, and which attracted the attention of the judges at the assizes.",
            "It would almost appear that the justices are jealous of each other in the performance of their duties, and this is attributed, as we were informed, to the high party feeling which prevails in the port.",
            "It was only after some time and care that the evidence could be properly taken and arranged.",
            "The witnesses already examined, and of whose testimony reports have already appeared in LLOYD'S NEWSPAPER, were again subjected to examination, and the other evidence taken extended to some length.",

            "On Wednesday, Alfred Feist, late master of St. Mary Newington workhouse, again surrendered on his bail, at the Lambeth police-court, for further examination, on the charge of disposing of the bodies of inmates who died in the workhouse, for anatomical purposes.",
            "One or two other cases similar to that of Mary Whitehead, which was investigated at the former hearing, were now gone into.",
            "The undertaker, Hogg, deposed that in cases when bodies were intended for anatomical purposes he generally received the necessary certificate from the defendant to send to the inspector under the Anatomy bill.",
            "The practice in the workhouse was, when paupers died there, to have them carried down to the dead-house and place them in a shell, and the undertaker had no means of learning the names of such persons, except from the master of the workhouse.",
            "Evidence was also given by Mr. William Ball, a clerk in the master's office, as to the practice followed in case no friends of the deceased applied to be allowed to follow the body to the grave, and also as to the disposal of unclaimed bodies.",
            "Mr. Mathews, on behalf of the prisoner, admitted that his client was not free from blame, in the lax-he might say the scandalous-manner in which the bodies of paupers had been treated, but contended that no sale of the bodies for profit had been made out, and that Hogg, the undertaker, who had access to the dead-house, ought to be placed at the bar rather than his client.",
            "Mr. Elliott said there could not be the slightest doubt that in the first case before him the prisoner knew that the deceased had friends, and he had been guilty of a fraud of a most revolting description, that of substituting the body of one for another, and making the friends believe they were following to the grave the body of their own relative.",
            "This was an offence against decency of the worst description.",
            "The case must go before a higher tribunal.",
            "It also appeared to him most culpable on the part of the board of guardians to allow bodies to be brought back from the hospital to the workhouse for interment.",
            "Mr. Robinson assured the magistrate that that which had been so justly condemned by his worship was entirely unknown to the respectable gentlemen who formed the board; and a number of the guardians present confirmed this assertion.",
            "The evidence in the case of Phoebe Clark, a prisoner, who had been in the workhouse, and who died on the 19th of February last, was then gone through.",
            "In this case the body was sent to Guy's and another substituted, and two of the sisters of Clark followed the strange body, in the belief it was their relative, to Victoria park, and saw the coffin interred there.",
            "Mr. Elliott was of opinion that this and the case taken on the former day would be abundant for the purposes of prosecution, and Mr. Robinson having undertaken that if indictments in other of the ten or twelve cases should be preferred, the solicitor for the defence should be furnished with the evidence in them, the prisoner was fully committed to take his trial on both charges.",
            "On an application by his counsel the prisoner was however admitted to bail in two sureties in 40l., and himself in 80l., to appear on the day of trial.",

            "As there is no treaty for the extradition of criminals between this country and the Hamburg authorities, but for the circumstance of the prisoner not being provided with the necessary papers, the police of Hamburg could not have interfered with him; and there is no doubt that the arrest of the prisoner was merely a contrivance to get him into the custody of the deceased officer, that he might be brought to England upon the charge of robbing Mr. Ballantine, and that the proceedings taken to effect this object were to a certain extent illegal.",
            "If the judges, upon consideration of the facts, should ultimately come to the same conclusion, the probability is that the capital sentence will not be carried out, but the punishment will be commuted to such an one as would probably have been inflicted if the prisoner had been convicted of manslaughter only.",
            "When the prisoner was informed of the respite, but at the same time told that he must not found any hopes that his life would ultimately spared, which might prove delusive if the legal point were decided against him, he expressed himself grateful for the respite that was afforded him, and evidently felt the impression that the capital sentence would not be carried out.",
            "The prisoner accounts for the extraordinary expressions made use of by him after the transaction, by saying that he was in a very excited state, and observing the angry feeling of the people on board the vessel, he was desirous that they should put an end to him, as, in the first burst of their indignation, they had threatened they would do.",
            "The prisoner seems to have entirely abandoned his atheistical notions, and attends chapel regularly, and pays great attention to the spiritual consolation offered him by the Rev. Mr. Davis, the ordinary of the gaol of Newgate.",

            "The case excited unusual interest owing to various circumstances.",
            "The prisoner, who resided with his mother at Smallbourn, three miles from Falkirk, and who is most respectably connected, was tried in September, 1857, along with another young man, at the Stirlingshire circuit, for breach of trust and embezzlement, in so far as he aided and abetted the frauds of the late Henry Salmon, manager of the branch of the Commercial bank at Falkirk, who, it may be remembered, on his extensive defalcations being discovered, took to flight, and eventually was found to have committed suicide in the court-yard of a Welsh inn.",
            "The two young men were not suspected of participation in the money's appropriated by Salmon, but were nevertheless convicted of the offence charged, and were each sentenced to two years' imprisonment.",
            "The representations made to the home secretary, however, succeeded in procuring the liberation of both at or before the expiry of six months.",
            "Reid accordingly returned to his mother's house in April last, and resided there until the occurrence of the event which a second time brought him to the criminal bar.",
            "His mother's servant, Margaret Taylor, had become pregnant by him, and been to three or four months, and he, in conjunction with the deceased, Dr. Thomas Girdwood, used instruments it is said to cause her to abort.",
            "This criminal act proved fatal to the young woman the next day; the night of her death the doctor who gave his aid committed suicide by taking laudanum, while Reid himself fled, but was apprehended in Walgow the following day.",
            "Evidence was gone into at great length, but it was of such a nature as to require in a public journal nothing more than a brief allusion to its principal features.",
            "The mother of the deceased described the appearances of the painful illness which preceded death, which at first she concluded arose from a disturbance of natural causes.",
            "She afterwards learned from the dying girl that she was suffering under a miscarriage, that the prisoner was the father of the child, and that on the previous day he had inflicted upon her serious injuries through the use of an instrument.",
            "The mother of the prisoner proved much to a similar effect, and that on speaking to her son on the subject, he said it was not he that did it (the operation) but Tom Girdwood; that Dr. Myrtle knew all about it, and that the case was not so bad against him as she expected.",
            "Dr. J. Girdwood, the father of Thomas Girdwood, deposed to speaking to his son about the catastrophe, and that the deceased had made a charge against him.",
            "He advised him to get out of the way as soon as possible, and he seemed stupefied by the statement made to him.",
            "Witness also saw the prisoner, who said to him, \"I used no instrument; if any instrument were introduced it must have been introduced by your son Tom.\"",
            "Witness said he did not believe that, but that did not alter the case so far as he, Reid, was concerned, and that for his part it was necessary for him to secure his safety by flight.",
            "Evidence was then given as to the suicide of young Dr. Girdwood immediately after the decease of the girl.",
            "The medical evidence was to the effect that death was the result of the injury effected by the operation, but whether by a professional person or not, could not be spoken to.",

The committee, although they adopted as the result of extensive inquiries their published programme, as likely to be sanctioned by the largest number of constituent bodies, do not prescribe it to any as the basis of their organisation. They are especially anxious that reformers should place themselves in the most advantageous position to pronounce on any Reform bill which may be introduced into parliament, as to how far it fairly complies with the people's reasonable demands, Hitherto their work, which has not been unproductive, has been accomplished at a very moderate outlay; but the time has clearly arrived when a bolder attitude must be taken, and without any elaborate agitation they must be prepared for a very large additional expenditure. Their efforts will necessarily be limited by the means placed at their disposal, and they respectfully solicit co-operation in their endeavors to render the House of Commons truly representative of the people.\"",

            "A labourer, named Jones, accounted for the deceased being found at his house by saying that she hurried in at nine on the preceding evening, deuterating that her husband had given her her death-blow, and she hoped that witness would allow her to lie down for a bit.",
            "Witness told her she might, and the woman flung herself down upon the bed, witness being obliged to go out and leave her there, but on his return home about two hours afterwards, he was surprised to find that she was still there, and dead.",

            "Mr. Shaw, a surgeon at Mile-end, deposed to being called to see the deceased, whom he found to be dead, and that his opinion, from an examination of her, was that she died from apoplexy, but whether it arose from excessive drinking or violence, he could not positively say, although there were certain marks of ill usage upon the body.",

Blagden, coroner for the western division of that county, on the body of Martha Ann Greenway, who had been murdered by her husband under the following frightful circumstances.",
            "It appears that the murderer, who was in good circumstances, and occupied a house in the village, returned from Bethlehem hospital on Friday week, where he had been confined for ten weeks, and was supposed to have perfectly recovered from his attack of insanity.",

            "They had two children aged respectively two years and a half, and eight months, and the husband seemed to have a great affection for the elder child, but did not pay the other any attention.",

            "The murder, no doubt, took place in the kitchen, but there was no derangement of the furniture of the apartment, so that it did not appear that any great struggle had taken place.",

It has been estimated that about 10,000 people witnessed the execution. Their conduct was orderly and becoming in a remarkable degree. There were 150 constabulary on the ground before the scaffold under the charge of Captain Stoker, Sub-inspectors Neynoe and Vallancy, Head-constable O'Donnell, &c. Many of the crowd remained until the body was cut down and placed in its coffin outside the gaol door, after which all dispersed quietly and orderly their several ways.\"",
            "TRIAL OF THE REV.",
            "JAMES ROE.",
            "On Wednesday, James Roe, forty-two, a gentlemanly-looking man, described in the calendar as a clergyman, was indicted, at the Central Criminal court, for feloniously forging and uttering a warrant or order for the payment of 6,000l., with intend to defraud.",
            "Mr. Giffard, in opening the case to the jury, said that the charge against the prisoner was one of a very serious character, and he was sorry to say that the inquiry was rendered still more painful from the fact that the prisoner was a clergyman of the church of England, and filling a highly respectable position in society.",
            "The learnel counsel said he was fearful that it would be necessary for him to make a somewhat lengthened statement of the circumstances under which the charge was preferred, but a short narrative of the principal facts will be sufficient to put the public in possession of the material points upon which the prosecution was founded.",
            "It appeared that the prisoner was the nephew of a Mr. Edward Roe, a person of considerable property, residing at Macclesfield, and that this gentleman had two other nephews, Mr. George Hartwell Roe, and Mr. John Onslow Roe.",
            "Mr. Edward Roe died on the 1st of January, 1859, having made a will and codicil on the previous 25th and 30th of December, by which he bequeathed a legacy of 500l, to the prisoner, and made his other two nephews his residuary legatees.",
            "The prisoner, there was no doubt, was exceedingly dissatisfied with this will, and he took proceedings in Chancery to have it set aside on the ground of the incompetence of the testator, and an issue was directed to be tried by the Court of Chancery.",
            "It will be sufficient to state that in all those proceedings the prisoner was defeated, and the validity of the will established.",
            "Nothing further appeared to have been done until the middle of last year, when prisoner put forward a letter which he represented to have been written by his uncle on the 30th of December, 1858, and in which was enclosed a cheque upon Messrs. Brockelhurst, his bankers at Macclesfield, for 6,000l., and he then took further proceedings in Chancery to endeavour to obtain that sum out of the estate of the testator.",
            "The case on the part of the prosecution, was that this letter was merely an ingenious device on the part of the prisoner, and that not only were the letter and the cheque forgeries, but that the prisoner had also forged the post-office stamp that appeared upon the envelope of the letter.",
            "The cheque that was the subject of the prosecution, and an envelope and letter that had been impounded by order of the Court of Chancery during the proceedings, were also produced.",
            "The letter was read.",
            "It was as follows: -\"Macclesfield, Dec. 30, 1858. -Dear James, -I am being made to do what I do not want. If I am gone when you come use this money for the benefit of yourself and family. (Signed) E. ROE.\"",
            "-The cheque in question was written upon the same sheet of paper.",
            "Evidence was given to prove that the deceased was not in a condition, on the day which corresponded with the date on the cheque, to have written the document in question, and several witnesses deposed that the handwriting was not that of the deceased more, over, the latter always signed his Christian name in full.",
            "Mr. P. Wadsworth, one of the attesting witnesses, however, admitted that the writing of the cheque and the letter was similar to the handwriting of the deceased two or three years before.",
            "Mr. Surrey, an engraver, of Fleet-street, deposed to making stamps and letters, capable of forming the words Macclesfield and Bath, which were ordered of him by the prisoner, and his impression was that the stamp which appeared upon the envelope containing the cheque had been made from the impression of one of the stamps so ordered.",
            "Mrs. Anne Dutton, employed at the Macclesfield post-office, said that the envelope produced could not have passed through their office on the 1st of January, because it bore the initial letter D, which was not used until after the 3rd of January.",
            "Mr. John Prior, a clerk in the Bath post-office, deposed that he had examined the envelope which purported to bear the stamp of that office, and he said that it was not a genuine one.",
            "Amongst other evidence given, Mr. George Heartwell Roe deposed that he was the acting executor, and one of the residuary legatees under the will of his uncle; and at the time of his death there was only 1,699l. at his bankers' to meet the supposed cheque for 6,000l.",
            "The jury returned a verdict of \"Guilty.\"",
            "The learned judge sentenced the prisoner to ten years' penal servitude.",
            "SUSPECTED MURDER IN GLASGOW.",
            "The North British Mail of Thursday says: -Scarcely has the excitement caused by the 'Motherwell mystery' had time to subside, when we are astonished by another case, equally mysterious, and in some points closely resembling the 'mysterious occurrence at Motherwell.'",
            "A man, named James M'Caffery, a funnerman, in the employment of Messrs. Merry and Cunningham, at Cairnbroe, disappeared on the morning of Sabbath last, and has not been heard of.",
            "The facts of the case, so far as we have been able to gather them, are as follows: -On Saturday night last, M'Caffery was in Airdrie, along with his brother, John M'Caffery, and other two men, named respectively John Mulholland and William M'Groty.",
            "They had been in one or two public-houses, and at a late hour they left the town to go home.",
            "The brother states that, instead of going direct home, they went round by Willlet, and went to a publichouse there, where they had 'half a mutchkin.'",
            "He and his (now missing) brother then left to go home.",
            "When they were near the bridge which crossed the Caledonian railway at Whitlout, he heard two men coming running after them (not those with whom they had been in company previously), and who, on coming up to where they were, began to quarrel with his brother.",
            "James Caffery then ran away, and the two men followed him towards Greenend and across the bridge over the Calder branch of the Monklands canal.",
            "In a short time, one of the men returned, and addressing John M'Callion, said with an oath, If you were not such an old man, I would give you as much, or words to that effect, and then passed on; and John M'Caffery, who seemed to have been pretty much under the influence of drink at the time, also went on homewards.",
            "A woman, who lives at the Old Store, Calder, just immediately beside the bridge which crosses the canal before referred to, says that about one or two o'clock on the Sabbath morning she heard a noise of men quarrelling and fighting, and that she heard someone say, \"I'll have your life before you to Carron-rowe;\" and she also heard cries of \"Murder!\"",
            "Since the occurrence diligent inquiries have been made by the police of the missing man's relatives both here and in Glasgow and elsewhere, but no trace of him has been found.",
            "The canal has also been dragged by the police, under the superintendence of Captain Clark and John M'Donald, Esq., procurator-fiscal; but although it is stated that the missing man's bonnet has been found on the canal bank, near to Suicide-bridge, nearly a mile distant from the place where the quarrel commenced, up to the time we write the body has not been discovered.",
            "Those who lived beside M'Caffery stated that he and his wife sometimes quarrelled, and that he was in the habit of leaving her for a short time, but this statement is stoutly denied by the woman herself.",
            "-John M'Caffery states that the two men who ran after his brother were not personally known to him, and they are still at large.",
            "The whole affair is shrouded in a mystery which, judging from present appearances, will not be easily solved.",
            "SERIOUS DOUBLE CHARGE.",
            "On Wednesday, William Scones, aged forty-eight, the keeper of the Alpha Arms beer shop, Alpha-place, Islington; John Beeston, aged twenty-one, described as a hawker, having no home; and Henry Smith, a hawker of catameat, were charged at Clerkenwell police-court - Scones with committing a rape on Elizabeth Watson, a servant, of Lludham, Nottingham, and Beeston and Smith, with aiding and abetting him in the commission of the same, at the parish of Islington, also stealing a half-sovereign her money.",
            "The complainant it appeared came to town on Tuesday morning, and according to her statement was accosted by Smith, at King's-cross, and taken by him to Scones' beer shop.",
            "When she had been there a short time with Beeston and Smith, Scones came into the parlour having been in and out two or three times before, and she was then seized by Smith and Beeston, forced on the table, and, although she screamed and struggled violently, the prisoner Scones committed the crime with which he was charged.",
            "She could not kick Scones because Beeston held her legs.",
            "When she went into the parlour she had a bag, in which was half a sovereign, and when she got outside the house she found that her money was gone.",
            "Before she left one of the prisoners offered her half a sovereign not to say anything about what had occurred, but she refused to accept it.",
            "As soon as she saw a policeman she informed him of what had occurred, and went with him to the station, and having given a description of the prisoners, she went with the police to the Alpha Arms, and the prisoners were taken in charge.",
            "Complaints are frequently being made that skittle sharpers and thieves are allowed to congregate at King's-cross, to trap the unwary that arrive by the Great Northern railway.",
            "The complainant, who gave her evidence in anything but a becoming manner, on cross examination by Mr. Wakeling, said that she had been in town for two years before she went to the country a short time back.",
            "She also denied being the worse for liquor.",
            "The prisoner Smith said the complainant was the worse for liquor when he took her into the house.",
            "The defence set up was the denial of the charge in toto.",
            "Mr. Barker said it was a case for further inquiry, and remanded the prisoners until Tuesday next.",
            "Mr. Wakeling applied for bail to be taken for the prisoner Scones.",
            "There was no evidence against him, except the unsupported statement of the prosecutrix.",
            "Mr. Barker declined to accede to the application at present.",
            "If Mr. Wakeling pleased he could apply to a judge at chambers on the question of bail.",
            "The police applied that something might be given to the girl out of the poor-box, but it not being a fit case she was sent to the workhouse.",
            "MANSLAUGHTER AT WENTING.",
            "On Thursday, Samuel Howard, aged thirty-eight, described as a labourer, was indicted at the Central Criminal Court for feloniously killing and slaying Sarah Smith, a female with whom he cohabited as his wife.",
            "Mr. Orridge appeared on the part of the prosecution, and Mr. Ribton defended the prisoner.",
            "It appeared from the evidence that on the morning of the 2nd of January, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner went to the police station at Wapping, and told the inspector that he had found his wife dead, and he knew that he should be taken up for it; therefore he had come to give himself in charge.",
            "The inspector, upon hearing his statement, sent a policeman named Busby with the prisoner to his house, 6, New-court, St. George's-in-the-east.",
            "Upon the officer going into his room he found the deceased on the floor, dressed, lying on her back, dead.",
            "The prisoner said she had fallen out of bed and struck herself, which killed her.",
            "Busby and prisoner then went and fetched a doctor, but it was of no avail, as the deceased had been dead sometime.",
            "Several witnesses living in the court proved that they heard the prisoner and deceased quarrelling during the night and that they heard a fall, but did not take any further notice, and went into their own homes.",
            "One witness said he saw the prisoner come home about ten o'clock the previous night, and heard him say, \"I will do for her to-night.\"",
            "Dr. Bos, of High-street, Shadwell, said he was called in to see the deceased by the officer on the morning in question.",
            "The prisoner told him that when he came home there was no fire and they quarrelled, and he struck her and went out.",
            "When coming home again he got into bed, and in the morning he found her dead on the floor.",
            "He afterwards made a post-mortem examination of the body.",
            "The immediate cause of death was disease of the heart.",
            "There were two marks on the face and two at the side of the head by blows, which had accelerated death.",

            "On Monday afternoon, eight men, suspected of being the parties concerned in the murder of James Gray, keeper on the estate of W. Cook, Esq., of Roydon-hall, East Peckham, were taken before the magistrates at Town Malling.",
            "The men gave the names of Robert Walter (Warterbury), John Wood (of Brighton, a pensioner), and John Honey, Thomas Fowler, William Hammond, Robert Simpson, George Honey, and Thomas Roney, of Merewith and Netsted respectively, and they were apprehended on the charge of night poaching on lands belonging to Mr. William Cook, of Roydon hall, and with the wilful murder of James Gray, head-keeper of that gentleman.",
            "Captain Buxton, chief constable of the Kent county constabulary, offered no evidence against the first named two prisoners, who had been apprehended simply because they had broken heads.",
            "Ellis had stated to the constables that he was at the affray, and that he did not care what they did to him.",
            "They were consequently discharged.",
            "Captain Buxton, on applying for the remand of the other prisoners, said he had a strong chain of circumstantial evidence, which he did not think it right to go into upon that occasion.",

            "The under-keeper, George Sexton, (who was close to the head keeper during the affray), swore that to the best of his belief John Honey was the person who shot the keeper; that Sampson knocked him (Sexton) down, and that George Honey, Thomas Honey, and Thomas Fowler were present and taking part in the affray.",
            "The evidence against Hammond was that some six months since he uttered threats against deceased, and that upon his house being searched a jacket with spots of blood upon it, an old gun, a barrel of a gun, some powder, and a shot bag, together with a portion of a newspaper, containing part of a report of the death and last moments of the late prince consort; a singular coincidence being that the wadding of a gun was found near the spot where Gray fell, which also was a place of a newspaper containing part of a similar report.",

            "There is little doubt the prisoner was actuated to commit the act from a feeling of revenge, she having, in October last, been charged at this court with two soldiers for an assault on Foskett, when she was committed for seven days in default of paying a fine, and, from the threat she made use of, there is reason to believe that she intended to take Foskett's life.",
            "Joseph Reed, 60 D, said he was called to the Duke of York, and saw the prisoner there, and the man Foskett was sitting on a form bleeding from the head copiously.",
            "The prisoner said, \"Look here, fatty (the constable is a stout man); so help me God, I did it, and intended to do so.\"",

            "The knife (a large clasp one) produced is the same.",
            "It had blood on it at the time.",
            "The prisoner had been drinking, but she well knew what she was about.",
            "He then took Foskett to the Middlesex hospital.",

            "Two attempts have recently been made to break into the house of a man named Woodcock, who is seventy five years of age, and keeps a small grocery shop at Mankinholes, near Todmorden.",
            "The old man and his wife sleep in a bed on the ground floor, in a room lighted by a little old-fashioned window of no great strength, the panes of glass being let into a framework of lead; and one night, about six weeks ago, Woodcock was awoke by a pane of the window being broken, and a hand being thrust through the aperture to unfasten the casement.",
            "The old man told the burglar that unless the hand were withdrawn he would chop it off, and this threat had the desired effect of frightening the man, and causing him to desist.",
            "On Friday night last, however, a more desperate attack was made by two burglars, one of whom struck the window a blow with something that had the effect of driving in the whole of the glass and framework together.",
            "The burglars then entered the room, and one of them seized the wife, while the other pursued the husband into another room, whither he had gone for a weapon with which to defend himself.",
            "It was a dark night, but the old man got hold of a pair of tongs, and struck the burglar who followed him a severe blow with the heavy end of the tongs.",
            "The next moment the burglar caught him by the throat with one hand, while he endeavoured to strike him with a carpenter's axe with the other.",
            "The grasp of the throat was so severe that it forced blood from the mouth and nostrils of Woodcock, but still the old man succeeded in striking the axe from his assailant's hand by hitting him a blow with the tongs across the wrist.",
            "This caused the burglar to stoop and search for the axe, and while he did so Woodcock went through the bedroom and escaped by the window to get assistance from his neighbours.",
            "When he returned with some of his neighbours, it was found that the burglars had decamped, without taking anything with them.",
            "In the room where the struggle had taken place, a sharp axe and a man's cap were found on the floor.",
            "A good deal of blood was on the floor, some of which it is thought had been shed by the burglar in the struggle.",
            "Woodcock was a good deal exhausted and excited through the encounter, and several of his neighbours remained with him during the remainder of the night, and, from the care taken of him, it is thought that he will recover from the injuries he sustained.",
            "There is reason to believe the police are on the track of the men who entered the house.",
            "EMBEZZLEMENT BY A TRAVELLER.",
            "On Thursday, Robert Simpson, late clerk to Messrs. Lee and Jourdein, the well-known and extensive colliery-owners, was brought up on remand at Bow-street police-court on a charge of embezzlement.",
            "It appears that in September, 1861, the prisoner was engaged by Mr. Jourdein upon very high recommendations to take charge of one of their numerous branch establishments, situate at Putney.",
            "His duties were to superintend the business of the Putney branch; to travel in that locality and take orders from customers; to receive money in payment for coals supplied, and to account for the same in a weekly report, which he delivered to Mr. Jourdein every Monday at the head office of the firm, 9, Lancaster place, Strand.",
            "He was paid a salary of 24s. a week besides travelling expenses, and he had a house at Putney free of rent and taxes.",
            "Lately Messrs. Lee and Jourdein had discovered that a small sum which was due from a customer had been paid to the prisoner, who had not accounted for it, and, as Mr. Lewis explained, such occurrences were very annoying, as customers felt it to be unpleasant to have accounts sent in again after they had been paid.",
            "Upon calling on the prisoner for an explanation the prosecutors received a letter from the prisoner, acknowledging that during the first eighteen months he had received about 60l, which he had not accounted for, and giving a list of the customers whose payments he had kept back.",
            "In that letter he expressed great regret for his conduct, and begged hard to be forgiven for the sake of his wife and children.",
            "At the former hearing Mr. Lewis observed that Messrs. Lee and Jourdein were most reluctant to prosecute the prisoner, on account of his hitherto excellent character.",
            "He had been for many years well known and highly respected in the neighbourhood where he resided, and was the very last person they would have thought capable of any dishonesty.",
            "But considering the extent to which they had been robbed, having lost upwards of 3,000l. by the defalcations of clerks during the last two years, they felt they had no course but to give the prisoner into custody.",
            "Mr. Hall said it would be best to take that course in every instance.",
            "\u2013Mr. Lewis said that when appeals were made and letters written similar to that of the prisoner, speaking in a most affecting manner of his wife and children, kind-hearted people found it very much against the grain to act with severity and harshness.",
            "Messrs. Lee and Jourdein had therefore forgiven several dishonest clerks, but they felt that they could not go on in such a course for ever.",
            "Upon the case being called on Thursday, however, Mr. Lewis said that some representations had been made by the prisoner's friends, which induced the prosecutors to believe that a lenient course might properly be adopted.",
            "His friends, it appeared, were willing to send him abroad, and there to find some employment for him.",
            "Hoping that the imprisonment and anxiety he had already undergone might operate as a warning for the future, Messrs. Lee and Jourdein were desirous, with the magistrate's permission, to withdraw from the prosecution.",
            "He wished distinctly to assure the magistrate that they acted thus purely from motives of compassion, and not with a view to any compromise, which, if offered, would have been indignantly refused.",
            "Mr. Hall discharged the prisoner, observing that he ought to feel deeply indebted to the prosecutors for their kindness.",
            "INCREASE OF INFANTICIDE.",
            "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Bedford held inquests in the board-rooms of St. George's, Hanover-square, and Mount-street, Grosvenor-square, into the cases attending the deaths of two children, whose bodies were found as described in the evidence.",
            "In the first case, Colonel William Frederick Johnstone, residing at 23, South-street, Park-lane, stated that he was walking in Hyde-park at eight o'clock on Sunday morning last, and when about a hundred yards from the Grosvenor-gate towards the Marble arch, he saw a small black leather bag, or reticule, lying under one of the seats.",
            "Without ascertaining its contents he took it to the lodge-keeper, who did not open it for some time, when to his horror and surprise it was found to contain the dead body of a fine male child.",
            "Dr. William Bloxam said he had examined the body, which was that of a fine male child.",
            "There was very considerable compression of the head and effusion of blood between the scalp and the brain.",
            "He had no doubt the child had respired, and the compression of the head was sufficient to destroy life.",
            "The coroner then remarked on the extraordinary nature of the case, and that it was the first instance he knew of such a bag being used to secrete the body.",
            "-The jury returned a verdict \"That the deceased was found dead in Hyde-park.\"",

            "This search caused a great deal of talk in the neighbourhood, and ultimately coming to the knowledge of the prisoner's brother and father, who lived at Chorley, they recollected that the prisoner, who had come home about five o'clock on the morning of the murder had been dealing with a watch, which, as far as their memory went, corresponded with the watch of the murdered man.",

            "When gentlemen were summoned on the jury or grand jury at the Lord Mayor's court and did not attend they were fined; and the prisoner seemed to make it a practice to ascertain who the gentlemen were who were fined for non-attendance, and then come forward and make a false affidavit in order to get them excused from the fine.",
            "This had been reduced to such a system that it was found that some gentlemen never appeared in the jury-box at all, while others who did attend to their duties were continually complaining that they were taken away from their business much more frequently than they ought to be in consequence of the non-attendance of other gentlemen who ought to serve upon the jury.",

            "He was convicted at the Central Criminal court in 1863 for feloniously embezzling 38l, the monies of his employer, and he was sentenced to four months' imprisonment.",
            "This light sentence was owing to his appearing to be very ill and fainting in the dock, and he was looked upon as an \"unfortunate young man.\"",
            "He subsequently obtained employment as an agent to the British Equitable Assurance office, and was in the receipt of good wages until November last, when it was discovered that he was a defaulter to the amount of 28l., and he was dismissed.",
            "Before and after that time he carried on a most impudent and astounding fraud, by representing that he was the agent of several insurance offices, and that he was authorised to insure life, property, and plate-glass in the Sun, the Phoenix, the Royal, the Norwich Union, and sundry other offices, and money flew into his pockets very rapidly.",
            "He always gave receipts, and promised the policies of assurance in a day, a fortnight, or a month; but they were never forthcoming.",

            "\"3. It falls heavily on particular classes of property, impounding to an important extent advertisements in journals. In America, any man who wishes to lend or to hire, to buy or to sell, announces his wish, without being subject to any duty, for 1s.",
            "\"4. It acts most injuriously on literary works striving at cheapness. The cost of advertising sometimes amounts to more than the whole profit of author and publisher on works which are successful.",
            "\"5. It is a tax which goes far to fetter the free extension of the press, and prevents the circulation of a sound and wholesome literature among working men In America there are 350 daily papers, in England there are only ten.",
            "\"6. It creates a monopoly. It is only the comparatively prosperous tradesman who can afford to advertise-the intelligent mechanic is excluded from newspaper publicity.",
            "\"7. It is one among many of the fiscal errors committed when the true principles of taxation were comparatively unknown. It involves the same principle by which the lowest-priced Bohea is taxed at the same rate as the highest-priced Pekoe or Souchong-on which the miserable shirt-maker is made to pay a duty of about 300 per cent. on the original value of the article which she consumes, while the rich pay about eighty per cent. only.",

The blank wall, the advertising van (dangerously blocking up the public thoroughfares), the omnibus, the railway carriage, the railway station, the street pavement, and many other modes of advertising, reduce the amount paid to Government to a comparatively small amount, and leave its pressure exactly where it is most severely felt, and where many grounds of public policy condemn it.",

In a word-it is a great impediment to trade, literature, and labour seeking a market, through publicity, and to the newspaper press for that reason; while the small amount of revenue which it yields-about \u00a36,000 per annum renders it altogether unworthy of retention, at a cost of a tithe of the hardship and injustice which it inflicts.\"",

            "It is a very lonely place, and the house in which they lived having been divided into two, the other was occupied by an aged woman named Norman.",
            "Near these houses was a barn, which had not been used for many years, and consequently it is in a very dilapidated state, the wooden floor being gone, and only some stone sleepers remaining.",
            "The mother of the poor girl, Coles, the victim of this diabolical crime, left her house on the morning of Tuesday, the 8th inst., to go to work, and shortly after the son also went to his work at a neighbouring quarry, the deceased being left at home to attend to the affairs of the house.",
            "About ten o'clock the old woman, Mary Norman, who is eighty-five years of age, in going along the passage through the houses, observed that the door of Cole's house was open, and saw the deceased sitting on one side of the fire-place, while a man named Bailey, who lived at a short distance, was seated on the other.",
            "The deceased was not seen alive after that time.",
            "About eleven o'clock a man named Sedgbeer, who was working opposite the entrance to Lype, saw Bailey advancing towards the place at which he (Sedgbeer) was in a hurried manner; and, on arriving at the spot where he stood, he observed that Bailey was labouring under excitement.",
            "Bailey then proceeded to the quarry at which deceased's brother was working, and remained there, occasionally working for a short time, during which he partook of the dinner.",
            "At four o'clock Bailey left the quarry, and soon afterwards he called at the cottages at Lype, and inquired if \"the old woman (Coles) or any of them\" had returned.",
            "His mother replied in the negative, and he then went away.",
            "About seven o'clock the boy Coles returned, and, missing his sister, he went to meet his mother, who returned with him, and made inquiries for the poor girl at some neighbouring cottages.",
            "Failing to obtain any information respecting her, they searched their own premises, and ultimately the barn, the door of which they found closed.",
            "The mother went in, and on going to a dark part of the barn discovered the body of her child, whose clothes had been thrown up over her person as far as the stays would admit.",
            "She carried the body to her house, and then it was seen that her throat had been cut in a most horrible manner.",
            "Information of the circumstances having been given to the constables, they immediately proceeded to the house of Bailey's father, who lives at a short distance from the cottages, but whose house is in the parish of Luxborough.",
            "They found the son in bed, and, having stated that they were come to take him into custody on a charge of murder, the prisoner exclaimed, \"I didn't murder her;\" but he admitted that he had been at the house on his way from work, and stated that on leaving she accompanied him a short distance, and then returned.",
            "On him was found a knife, which was, of course, taken from him.",
            "On examining the barn blood was found on some ashes near the door, and also part of a bucklestrap, which was identified as belonging to the prisoner; the other part was found upon him.",

            "This mark was in a place which a person would pass over in proceeding from the barn to the spot at which Sedgbeer was when the prisoner went towards him.",
            "On examining the prisoner's clothes blood was found in different parts, and there was a line of blood over them from left to right, which had been partially washed out.",
            "On Friday, Mr. Hole, surgeon, made an examination of the body of the deceased, being accompanied by the coroner, Mr. Munckton, and marks of two severe blows were found on the top of the head, and also a mark of a severe blow over the left eye.",
            "There were two stabs in the neck, one on each side, and these corresponded with the blade of the knife found on the prisoner.",
            "There was a horrid gash right across the neck, from left to right, which divided all the principal parts down to the bone, and at the bottom of this cut was the mark of another stab, between two of the vital vertebrae or neck bones.",
            "From the appearances there could be no doubt that the murderer first stunned his victim by striking her on the head, and then dragged her to a darker part of the barn, where, placing the back of her neck on one of the stone sleepers, he completed the horrid crime.",
            "On Friday, the prisoner was taken before the Rev. G. F. Luttrell and Mr. Hele, at Dunster, magistrates of the district, and an investigation into the circumstances took place.",

            "A child, who had been the playmate of Blair's daughter Amelia, was greatly concerned at this, for Amelia had told her of the dreadful threats in which her father indulged.",
            "It would seem that round about Blair's house people had misgivings.",
            "They appeared to have been prepared by the violence of his conduct and language for a catastrophe.",
            "He had given way to drink: he had been suspended from his work at the Bow-common gas works.",
            "He had suffered from delirium tremens, and in his excited moments he had been heard to declare that he would murder his family and destroy himself.",
            "Blair was seen to fetch some beer on Sunday evening; and from that time nothing had been heard of him or the family.",
            "When the police, at the instigation of the neighbours, broke into the house on Monday morning, they found that the mad drunkard had carried out his awful threats to the letter.",

            "According to the medical testimony the woman and her children had all been murdered in their sleep, and then the murderer had destroyed himself.",
            "Neighbours' testimony goes to show that Blair, when calm and rational, and free from the influence of drink, was an affectionate husband and father.",
            "He had a comfortable home.",
            "He was, for his rank, fairly prosperous.",
            "His suspension from work was, it is believed, caused by his intemperance.",
            "Had Blair not given way to the most terrible vice which afflicts the working classes; which wrecks fair homes, fills prisons, and leads to the workhouse-he would have shrunk with horror and loathing even from the printed record of such a series of crimes as he, with his own drunkard's hand, committed.",
            "Blair's crimes suggest a return to a subject which has been left dormant for some time past.",
            "Should not men reduced to the insane condition in which he was, by alcoholic poisoning, be placed under restraint?",
            "When a man has become known in his neighbourhood as an habitual drunkard, in whose brain homicidal ideas are working; when he has ceased to have any restraint over himself; when drink has become an unappeasable craving within him; surely the time has come to protect both himself and those who are dependent upon him!",
            "Had Blair been put under restraint in time, the probability is that he would have reformed.",

            "It is a tangled subject which presses for immediate solution, in a society like ours, where half the crime and half the poverty of the land are directly traceable to drunkenness.",
            "In Blair's case we have evidence that his poor children went to bed at night dreading lest their father should carry out upon them the threats which he was wont to mutter in his cups.",
            "The children next door were half prepared to find their playmates murdered any morning.",
            "From these indications of the impression the drunkard had produced around him, we may imagine the life his wife must have led, and the long sad hours which preceded the final catastrophe.",
